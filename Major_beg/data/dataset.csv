2,,"NLP based Machine Learning Approaches for Text 
Summarization",,"Due to the plethora of data available today, text 
summarization has become very essential to gain just the right 
amount of information from huge texts. We see long articles in 
news websites, blogs, customers’ review websites, and so on. This 
review paper presents various approaches to generate summary 
of huge texts. Various papers have been studied for different 
methods that have been used so far for text summarization. 
Mostly, the methods described in this paper produce Abstractive 
(ABS) or Extractive (EXT) summaries of text documents. Querybased summarization techniques are also discussed. The paper 
mostly discusses about the structured based and semantic based 
approaches for summarization of the text documents. Various 
datasets were used to test the summaries produced by these 
models, such as the CNN corpus, DUC2000, single and multiple 
text documents etc. We have studied these methods and also the 
tendencies, achievements, past work and future scope of them in 
text summarization as well as other fields","We have seen that due to abundant availability of data, text 
summarization has a very vital role in saving user’s time, as 
well as resources. Text summarization is indeed an important 
tool for today. We have seen the use of various algorithms and 
methods for this purpose. These methods, in individual and 
together give different types of summaries. Their accuracy 
score can be compared to find the better and more concise 
summaries. For this purpose, ROGUE score has been used 
more frequently. Similarly, in some cases TF_IDF scores have 
been used too. 
The summaries generated using these methods are not 
always up to the mark. Sometimes, it’s also irrelevant to the 
original document. Therefore, this topic is ongoing and people 
have done various works on this. There isn’t any specific 
model that generates best summaries. So, for future, the models 
discussed can be modified for more accurate summaries. For 
e.g., we could use GAN’s and transfer learning. For future, this 
can give a way to develop and enhance further ideas for text 
summarization. ",Natural Language Processing,"The article discusses the importance of text summarization due to the abundance of data available today. Various approaches, including abstractive and extractive methods, as well as query-based techniques, are presented. The paper focuses on structured and semantic-based approaches and discusses the datasets used for testing these methods. While the accuracy of the summaries generated using these methods can be compared, there is no specific model that generates the best summaries. The article suggests that GANs and transfer learning could be used to improve future text summarization models.",Natural Language Processing

deep learning",Text mining . Abstractive text summarization . Relation extraction . Deep learning," Abstractive Text Summarization (ATS), which is the task of constructing summary
sentences by merging facts from different source sentences and condensing them into a shorter
representation while preserving information content and overall meaning. It is very difficult
and time consuming for human beings to manually summarize large documents of text. In this
paper, we propose an LSTM-CNN based ATS framework (ATSDL) that can construct new
sentences by exploring more fine-grained fragments than sentences, namely, semantic phrases.
Different from existing abstraction based approaches, ATSDL is composed of two main stages,
the first of which extracts phrases from source sentences and the second generates text
summaries using deep learning. Experimental results on the datasets CNN and DailyMail
show that our ATSDL framework outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of both
semantics and syntactic structure, and achieves competitive results on manual linguistic quality
evaluation","In this paper, we develop a novel LSTM-CNN based ATSDL model that overcomes several
key problems in the field of TS. The present ETS models are concerned with syntactic
structure, while present ATS models are concerned with semantics. Our model draws on the
strengths of both of summarization models. The new ATSDL model firstly uses phrase
extraction method called MOSP to extract key phrases from the original text, and then learns
the collocation of phrases. After training, the model will generate a phrase sequence that meets
the requirement of syntactic structure. In addition, we use phrase location information to solve
the rare words problem that almost all ATS models would encounter. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments on two different datasets and the result shows that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both semantics and syntactic structure.",Text summarization,The article presents a new framework for abstractive text summarization (ATS) called the LSTM-CNN based ATSDL model.

with Experts and Anti-Experts",,"Despite recent advances in natural language
generation, it remains challenging to control
attributes of generated text. We propose DEXPERTS: Decoding-time Experts, a decodingtime method for controlled text generation

the ensemble, tokens only get high probability if they are considered likely by the experts and unlikely by the anti-experts. We apply DEXPERTS to language detoxification and
sentiment-controlled generation, where we
outperform existing controllable generation
methods on both automatic and human evaluations. Moreover, because DEXPERTS operates
only on the output of the pretrained LM, it is
effective with (anti-)experts of smaller size, including when operating on GPT-3. Our work

5,,A Survey of Knowledge-enhanced Text Generation,,"The goal of text-to-text generation is to make machines express like a human in many applications such as
conversation, summarization, and translation. It is one of the most important yet challenging tasks in natural
language processing (NLP). Various neural encoder-decoder models have been proposed to achieve the goal
by learning to map input text to output text. However, the input text alone often provides limited knowledge
to generate the desired output, so the performance of text generation is still far from satisfaction in many
real-world scenarios. To address this issue, researchers have considered incorporating (i) internal knowledge
embedded in the input text and (ii) external knowledge from outside sources such as knowledge base and
knowledge graph into the text generation system. This research topic is known as knowledge-enhanced text
generation. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of the research on this topic over the past five
years. The main content includes two parts: (i) general methods and architectures for integrating knowledge
into text generation; (ii) specific techniques and applications according to different forms of knowledge data.
This survey can have broad audiences, researchers and practitioners, in academia and industry.","In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of current representative research efforts and
trends on knowledge-enhanced text generation and expect it can facilitate future research. To summarize, this survey aims to answer two questions that commonly appear in knowledge-enhanced
text generation: how to acquire knowledge and how to incorporate knowledge to facilitate text generation. Based on knowledge acquisition, the main content of our survey is divided into three sections
according to different sources of knowledge enhancement. Based on knowledge incorporation, we
first present general methods of incorporating knowledge into text generation and further discuss

Research Articles using BERT and GPT-2",,"With the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a growing urgency for medical community
to keep up with the accelerating growth in the new coronavirus-related literature.
As a result, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge has released a corpus
of scholarly articles and is calling for machine learning approaches to help bridging
the gap between the researchers and the rapidly growing publications. Here, we
take advantage of the recent advances in pre-trained NLP models, BERT and
OpenAI GPT-2, to solve this challenge by performing text summarization on this
dataset. We evaluate the results using ROUGE scores and visual inspection. Our
model provides abstractive and comprehensive information based on keywords
extracted from the original articles. Our work can help the the medical community,
by providing succinct summaries of articles for which the abstract are not already
available.
","Abstractive summarization still represents a standing challenge for deep-learning NLP. Even more
so when this task is applied to a domain-specific corpus that are different from the pre-training, are
highly technical, or contains low amount of training materials. COVID-19 Open Research Dataset

the text-to-text, multi-loss training strategy could be used to fine-tune a pre-trained language model
such as GPT-2 to perform abstractive summarization. The result is interpretable and reasonable, even
though it is not near human-level performance.

Traditional way of predicting Heart disease is doctor’s examination or number of medical tests such as ECG, Stress Test, and Heart MRI etc. Nowadays, Health care industry contains huge amount of heath care data, which contains hidden information. This hidden information is useful for making effective decisions. Computer based information along with advanced Data mining techniques are used for appropriate results. Neural network is widely used tool for predicting Heart disease diagnosis. In this research paper, a Heart Disease Prediction system (HDPS) is developed using Neural network. The HDPS system predicts the likelihood of patient getting a Heart disease. For prediction, the system uses sex, blood pressure, cholesterol like 13 medical parameters. Here two more parameters are added i.e. obesity and smoking for better accuracy. From the results, it has been seen that neural network predict heart disease with nearly 100% accuracy.","In this research paper, we have presented Heart disease prediction system (HDPS) using data mining and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques.

Within this scope of article, we conclude and analyse the sentiments and manifestations (comments, hastags, posts, tweets) of the users of the Twitter social media platform, based on the main trends (by keyword, which is mostly the ‘covid’ and coronavirus theme in this article) with Natural Language Processing and with Sentiment Classification using Recurrent Neural Network. Where we analyse, compile, visualize statistics, and summarize for further processing. The trained model works much more accurately, with a smaller margin of error, in determining emotional polarity in today's ‘modern’ often with ambiguous tweets. Especially with RNN. We use this fresh scraped data collections (by the keyword's theme) with our RNN model what we have created and trained to determine what emotional manifestations occurred on a given topic in a given time interval.","In this work, we use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to classify emotions on tweets. We developed a model to analyse the emotional nature of various tweets, using the recurrent neural network for emotional prediction, searching for connections between words, and marking them with positive or negative emotions. Where instead of simple positive and negative extremes, we have classified the various texts into a much more articulated class of emotional strength (weakly positive/negative, strongly positive/negative). This has been combined with a keyword-based special data scraper, so we can apply our taught RNN model with these specific freshly scraped datasets. As a result, we get an emotional classification related to specific topics. What kind of tweets they were and what emotional class they belong to, what is the distribution on that topic at the emotional level within the given start interval. In the article, we focused most on the coronavirus and related emotional changes and fluctuations, and it was shown that the overall positive manifestation and presence on the social platform remained on social media surfaces during this pandemic. Of course, in addition to negative and other manifestations. Over time, positivity has strengthened, but there is also a stronger negative array that is natural. According to our expectations this topic remain positive manifestations, sometimes with a higher and sometimes with a smaller percentage. It can be seen that the recurrent neural network provides good performance and prediction in text classification. Where the RNN model brought a smaller amount of data in neutral result or completely reduced to zero that. Which proves that our model is ‘able to make’ a decision and categorize in some direction even on the basis of small details. Our comparisons were made mainly against TextBlob, which also worked very well and delivered stable results, but there were many times when the neutral results were above 30% compared to our RNN model, which we cannot use as usefully for further evaluations as for our RNN model. The classification of emotions for both models (TextBlob, RNN) was properly segmented.",Natural Language Processing,"The article discusses the use of natural language processing and sentiment classification using recurrent neural network to analyze sentiments and manifestations of Twitter users on the topic of COVID-19.

9,,Explaining Recurrent Neural Network Predictions in Sentiment Analysis,,"Recently, a technique called Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) was shown to deliver insightful explanations in the form of input space relevances for understanding feed-forward neural network classification decisions. In the present work, we extend the usage of LRP to recurrent neural networks. We propose a specific propagation rule applicable to multiplicative connections as they arise in recurrent network architectures such as LSTMs and GRUs. We apply our technique to a word-based bi-directional LSTM model on a five-class sentiment prediction task, and evaluate the resulting LRP relevances both qualitatively and quantitatively, obtaining better results than a gradient-based related method which was used in previous work","onclusion In this work we have introduced a simple yet effective strategy for extending the LRP procedure to recurrent architectures, such as LSTMs, by proposing a rule to backpropagate the relevance through multiplicative interactions. We applied the extended LRP version to a bi-directional LSTM model for the sentiment prediction of sentences, demonstrating that the resulting word relevances trustworthy reveal words supporting the classifier’s decision for or against a specific class, and perform better than those obtained by a gradient-based decomposition. Our technique helps understanding and verifying the correct behavior of recurrent classifiers, and can detect important patterns in text datasets. Compared to other non-gradient based explanation methods, which rely e.g. on random sampling or on iterative representation occlusion, our technique is deterministic, and can be computed in one pass through the network. Moreover, our method is self-contained, in that it does not require to train an external classifier to deliver the explanations, these are obtained directly via the original classifier. Future work would include applying the proposed technique to other recurrent architectures such as character-level models or GRUs, as well as to extractive summarization. Besides, our method is not restricted to the NLP domain, and might also be useful to other applications relying on recurrent architectures.

10,,A review of feature selection methods in medical applications,,"Feature selection is a preprocessing technique that identifies the key features of a given problem. It has traditionally been applied in a wide range of problems that include biological data processing, finance, and intrusion detection systems. In particular, feature selection has been successfully used in medical applications, where it can not only reduce dimensionality but also help us understand the causes of a disease. We describe some basic concepts related to medical applications and provide some necessary background information on feature selection. We review the most recent feature selection methods developed for and applied in medical problems, covering prolific research fields such as medical imaging, biomedical signal processing, and DNA microarray data analysis. A case study of two medical applications that includes actual patient data is used to demonstrate the suitability of applying feature selection methods in medical problems and to illustrate how these methods work in real-world scenarios.","In this study, we reviewed recent approaches to medical applications of feature selection; we showed that feature selection is a useful preprocessing tool that not only reduces the number of input features, thereby saving on future data collection but also helps practitioners in understanding the underlying causes of certain diseases. We considered three main types of medical applications, namely medical imaging, biomedical signal processing, and DNA microarray data, wherein feature selection methods are commonly used to solve problems associated with these types of medical applications. For each category, we provided brief background information, described early initiatives, listed widely used repositories of medical data, and examined recent studies on applications. We also demonstrated the suitability of applying feature selection in two real-world ophthalmology problems. In one case, feature selection outperformed previous classification results; in the second case, feature selection reduced the computation time required to extract the image features that had previously prevented the real-time use of a computer-aided system. With regard to future scope, it is important not to overlook the emerging Big Data scenario wherein millions of samples and features need to be simultaneously addressed. The state-of-the-art feature selection methods were not developed under that assumption; thus, most of them are unable to handle vast datasets. Therefore, it is imperative to develop more sophisticated feature selection methods (for example, parallel programming) that can tackle Big Data. Another issue to be considered is that real-time feedback is of paramount importance; this suggests that online feature selection methods are required, which is still a challenge for researchers.",Deep Learning and Machine Learning,"This study reviews the recent approaches to the medical applications of feature selection, which is a useful preprocessing tool that reduces the number of input features and helps practitioners in understanding the underlying causes of certain diseases.

11,,A review of the affects of worry and generalized anxiety disorder upon cardiovascular health and coronary heart disease,anxiety disorders; heart diseases; worry; depression; review,"The aims of this review article are to present psychophysiological and behavioral pathways for the involvement of worry and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) upon cardiovascular function. The review will focus on persons with and without coronary heart disease (CHD), and encompass etiological and prognostic studies. Articles (1975–2011) reporting on GAD or worry affecting CHD prognosis or cardiovascular function were found using MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS and PsychINFO database searches, and extracted to form a narrative review. Results: Available evidence in experimental and observational studies in CHD free samples consistently showed that worry was associated with diminished heart rate variability (HRV) and elevated heart rate. Worry and GAD were commonly associated with blood pressure and diagnosed hypertension or medication use in both disease-free and established CHD populations. No evidence was found to support worry being beneficial to cardiovascular function or conducive to health promoting behaviors. The literature indicated that measures of worry were associated with fatal and nonfatal CHD in seven etiological studies of initially disease-free individuals; however, females were underrepresented. Three studies reported that GAD was associated with poorer prognosis in establish CHD, independent of depression. The median GAD prevalence was 10.4% in 3266 patients across 15 studies, suggesting that GAD is marginally less common in CHD samples than is depression.","A growing literature highlights the association between worry and development of CHD. The association between worry, GAD and CHD risk factors (e.g. blood pressure), and HRV are leading mechanisms of cardiopathogenesis that may affect cardiovascular function. Findings regarding worry and GAD in established CHD are less clear. conclusion : A growing body of literature documents the role of GAD and worry in CHD and cardiovascular risk. In established CHD, GAD increased the risk for major cardiac events in three data-sets (Frasure-Smith & Lesperance, 2008; Martens et al., 2010; Tully et al., 2011) and lowered risk in one data-set (Parker et al., 2011). Importantly, there was insufficient evidence to suggest that GAD is merely a marker for other known CVD mechanisms in persons with established CHD. With respect to etiological follow up of initially disease-free individuals, data showed that worry was associated with subsequent CHD and fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular outcomes (Hamer et al., 2011; Holman et al., 2008; Kawachi et al., 1994; Kubzansky et al., 1997; Phillips et al., 2009; Scherrer et al., 2010; Vogt et al., 1994). There was insufficient evidence to suggest a dose–response relationship whereby GAD might exert greater cardiotoxic effects than worry. Limitations of interpreting the literature to date include that findings are predominantly among male samples and generalization to females is dually problematic, for GAD appears to disproportionately affect females (Andrews et al., 2010). The most prominent biological mechanisms of cardiopathogenesis in worry were diminished HRV in nonCHD samples, a finding yet to be consistently demonstrated in persons with documented CHD. Clarification of the impact of worry and GAD upon cardiovascular function in CHD will be informative to the design of psychological treatment strategies and to rule out possible adverse cardiotoxic effects. For example, in vivo exposure to worry imagery, an accepted psychotherapeutic treatment modality for GAD in nonCHD patients (Borkovec & Ruscio, 2001), is potentially associated with greater autonomic response and change in HRV that may have adverse cardiovascular implications for a person with GAD and comorbid CHD. Associations between GAD and CHD risk factors such as smoking, excess alcohol use, and hypertension belie the suggestion that excessive and uncontrollable worry (e.g. clinical GAD) might be beneficial to promote cardiovascular health. In fact, worry was reportedly not related to CVD reducing behavior changes (e.g. physical activity). Given that GAD research has lagged behind other anxiety disorder research in the past decade (Dugas, Anderson, Deschenes, & Donegan, 2010), the recommendation for further GAD research in CHD cannot be understated. A likely explanation for the limited GAD research in CHD samples is that studies, published only since 2008, were preceded by an extensive literature documenting the depression-CHD association. Frasure-Smith and Lespérance (2008), whom led the way in depression research post-MI, concluded that the effects of depression and anxiety on CHD might promote research into common genetic, environmental, and pathophysiological pathways and treatments. Broader cognitive processes, such as rumination, observed across a range of affective disorders may underlie associations with CHD (Larsen & Christenfield, 2009) and medical illnesses generally (Brosschot, Gerin, & Thayer, 2006).",Medical Data Analysis,"This review article examines the relationship between worry, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and cardiovascular function in both disease-free individuals and those with coronary heart disease (CHD).

Measures of worry are also linked to fatal and nonfatal CHD. However, the association between worry, GAD, and established CHD is less clear. The research highlights the need for further investigation into the effects of GAD on CHD and cardiovascular risk, particularly as it disproportionately affects females.

Asian countries and regions such as Japan, the Republic of Korea, the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Kingdom of Thailand have greater mortality and morbidity from stroke than from coronary heart disease (CHD), whereas the opposite is true in Western countries.1 The reasons why this specific situation is observed in countries with rapid and early-phase westernization, such as Japan and South Korea, are very interesting. The Seven Countries Study conducted by Keys et al2 in 1957 found that Japanese populations had lower fat intake, lower serum total cholesterol, and lower CHD than populations in the United States and Scandinavia, in spite of higher smoking rates. The serum total cholesterol level in Japan has increased rapidly since World War II in accordance with an increase in dietary fat intake from 10% of total energy intake per capita per day to 25%.1,2 Despite this increase, the specific characteristic of lower CHD incidence and mortality than that in Western countries has persisted.3,4 Whether Japanese people and certain other Asian populations have different risk factors for CHD than Western populations has been a subject of discussion for quite some time.","In Asian countries, stroke is more prominent than CHD. This is most likely due to a higher prevalence of hypertension and a lower level of serum total cholesterol in Asian countries. The population-attributable fraction of hypertension for CVD is as high as 60% in Asian countries. High blood pressure accompanies high salt intake in East Asia, whereas low serum total cholesterol accompanies lower fat intake. Reduction in salt consumption in East Asian countries, including Japan, is important for the reduction of CVD, especially stroke. Prevention of smoking is also an important strategy for reducing CVD in most Asian countries, especially for men. The population-attributable fraction of smoking for CVD is 30%. Recent westernization in Asian countries has increased fat consumption, which has been followed by an increase in serum total cholesterol. This may have caused the increase in CHD in Asian countries. The prevalence of obesity is also increasing, and this may also increase the prevalence of DM, glucose intolerance, and the metabolic syndrome. Management of these traditional risk factors for CVD is important for the prevention of CVD in Asian and Western countries.",Medical Data Analysis,"The prevalence of stroke is higher than that of coronary heart disease (CHD) in Asian countries, possibly due to a higher prevalence of hypertension and lower serum total cholesterol levels. The population-attributable fraction of hypertension for CVD is high in Asian countries, and reduction in salt consumption is important for reducing CVD, especially stroke. Smoking is also a significant risk factor for CVD in most Asian countries, especially for men.

Management of traditional risk factors for CVD, including hypertension, smoking, and obesity, is essential for the prevention of CVD in Asian and Western countries.",Medical Data Analysis
15,,Cardiovascular disease risk in women with pre-eclampsia: systematic review and meta-analysis,"Pre-eclampsia , Cardiovascular disease , Cerebrovascular disease , Hypertension","There is increasing evidence that pre-eclampsia, a principal cause of maternal morbidity, may also be a risk factor for future cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. This review aimed to assess the current evidence and quantify the risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD), cerebrovascular events and hypertension associated with prior diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. Medline and Embase were searched with no language restrictions, as were core journals and reference lists from reviews up until January 2012. Case–control and cohort studies which reported cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases or hypertension diagnosed more than 6 weeks postpartum, in women who had a history of pre-eclampsia relative to women who had unaffected pregnancies, were included. Fifty articles were included in the systematic review and 43 in the meta-analysis. Women with a history of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia were at significantly increased odds of fatal or diagnosed CVD [odds ratio (OR) = 2.28, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.87, 2.78], cerebrovascular disease (OR = 1.76, 95 % CI 1.43, 2.21) and hypertension [relative risk (RR) = 3.13, 95 % CI 2.51, 3.89]. Among pre-eclamptic women, pre-term delivery was not associated with an increased risk of a future cardiovascular event (RR = 1.32, 95 % CI 0.79, 2.22). Women diagnosed with pre-eclampsia are at increased risk of future cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, with an estimated doubling of odds compared to unaffected women. This has implications for the follow-up of all women who experience pre-eclampsia, not just those who deliver preterm. This association may reflect shared common risk factors for both pre-eclampsia and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease.","Pre-eclampsia is associated with an approximate twofold increase in odds of CVD and cerebrovascular disease, and a threefold increased risk of hypertension. We found no evidence that the risks of CVD increase when pre-eclampsia is associated with pre-term delivery, although acknowledge there are limitations to our methodology. Women who experience pre-eclampsia should be aware of their increased risk and may benefit from formal postnatal screening for accepted risk factors for CVD.",Medical Data Analysis,"Pre-eclampsia, a common complication of pregnancy, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), cerebrovascular events, and hypertension later in life.

16,,Childhood Interstitial Lung Disease: A Systematic Review,Childhood interstitial lung disease; chILD syndrome; Interstitial lung disease; Diffuse lung disease.,"Childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD) is a group of rare chronic and complex disorders of variable pathology. There has been no systematic review of published chILD research. This study aimed to describe chILD classification systems, epidemiology, morbidity, treatments, outcomes, and the impact of chILD on families and the burden on health services. A systematic literature search for original studies on chILD was undertaken in the major biomedical databases to the end of December 2013. Epidemiological studies, case series and studies describing classification systems were included. Single case studies were excluded. Results: The search yielded 37 publications that met study criteria. Four different chILD classification systems have been proposed in the past decade. The incidence of chILD has been estimated at 0.13–16.2 cases/100,000 children/year. One to five new cases presented to individual hospitals each year. In developed countries, the median mortality was 13% (6–19%). Morbidity and outcomes were highly variable and not systematically reported. Corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine were the most common treatments. The impact of chILD on families and the burden on health services has not been studied. Conclusions: The heterogeneity of the chILD group of disorders, different determinations of what constitutes a chILD disorder and, a paucity of large epidemiological studies precludes consolidation of results across studies. Consensus on chILD classification is needed to support diagnosis and allow direct comparisons of research evidence. Active disease surveillance and international patient registries are required to advance understanding and management of chILD.","In conclusion, the disorders that together constitute the group of diseases known as chILD are extremely heterogeneous and associated with high morbidity and mortality. Prospective, active surveillance of chILD through strategic international collaboration is needed to provide more accurate estimates of frequency. It is important that a single classification system for chILD is adopted globally to support direct comparisons of research evidence. Patient registries and randomized controlled intervention trials through international collaboration are required to provide an evidence base for improving the lives of children with these rare disorders. Studies that go beyond describing subjective outcomes and describe quality of life (e.g., need for oxygen, exercise capability, school attendance, regularity of symptoms, and duration) will support prognosis. For health services planning and to support families, the impacts of chILD should be addressed in prospective studies. Determining the burden of chILD on health services requires descriptive statistics beyond simply counting the number of cases. Rigorous study of the health service needs for these complex and chronic conditions is needed.",Medical Data Analysis,"Childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD) is a rare and complex group of disorders with variable pathology, morbidity, and mortality.

20,,Current Clinical Applications of Diffusion-Tensor Imaging in Neurological Disorders,"diffusion-tensor imaging, diffusion-tensor imaging scalar, postprocessing, neurological disorders.","Diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) is a noninvasive medical imaging tool used to investigate the structure of white matter. The signal contrast in DTI is generated by differences in the Brownian motion of the water molecules in brain tissue. Postprocessed DTI scalars can be used to evaluate changes in the brain tissue caused by disease, disease progression, and treatment responses, which has led to an enormous amount of interest in DTI in clinical research. This review article provides insights into DTI scalars and the biological background of DTI as a relatively new neuroimaging modality. Further, it summarizes the clinical role of DTI in various disease processes such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s dementia, epilepsy, ischemic stroke, stroke with motor or language impairment, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and depression. Valuable DTI postprocessing tools for clinical research are also introduced.","DTI is an emerging neuroimaging method for identifying microstructural changes.

We performed a systematic search on various databases from May 1975 to May 2014 to find articles concerning CYC therapy in IIM and IIM-ILD. The initial search involved 310 articles, and the 12 articles that met the study criteria were analyzed in detail. All studies were non-randomized. Intravenous CYC (IVCYC) was administered as treatment for IIM in 11 of the studies. Additionally, eight of the twelve studies assessed the effect of CYC in developing resistance steroids or in refractory IIM. IVCYC pulses of 0.3–1.0 g/m2 or 10–30 mg/kg were applied at weekly to monthly intervals for 6–12 months together with either glucocorticoids or another immunosuppressive agent. According to a comprehensive analysis of the studies, 80.8 % (42/52) and 73.1 % (38/52) of patients showed improvement in muscle strength and function. The CK levels of 87.5 % (35/ 40) of patients fell. The forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) improved in 57.6 % (34/59) and 64.3 % (27/42) of patients.

The advantage of machine learning in an era of medical big data is that significant hierarchal relationships within the data can be discovered algorithmically without laborious hand-crafting of features. We cover key research areas and applications of medical image classification, localization, detection, segmentation, and registration. We conclude by discussing research obstacles, emerging trends, and possible future directions.","A recurring theme in machine learning is the limit imposed by the lack of labelled datasets, which hampers training and task performance. Conversely, it is acknowledged that more data improves performance, as Sun et al. shows using an internal Google dataset of 300 million images. In general computer vision tasks, attempts have been made to circumvent limited data by using smaller filters on deeper layers, with novel CNN architecture combinations, or hyperparameter optimization. In medical image analysis, the lack of data is two-fold and more acute: there is general lack of publicly available data, and high quality labelled data is even more scarce. Most of the datasets presented in this review involve fewer than 100 patients. Yet the situation may not be as dire as it seems, as despite the small training datasets, the papers in this review report relatively satisfactory performance in the various tasks. The question of how many images are necessary for training in medical image analysis was partially answered by Cho et al. [88]. He ascertained the accuracy of a CNN with GoogLeNet architecture in classifying individual axial CT images into one of 6 body regions: brain, neck, shoulder, chest, abdomen, pelvis. With 200 training images, accuracies of 88-98% were achieved on a test set of 6000 images. While categorization into various body regions is not a realistic medical image analysis task, his report does suggest that the problem may be surmountable. Being able to accomplish classification with a small dataset is possibly due to the general intrinsic image homogeneity across different patients, as opposed to the near-infinite variety of natural images, such as a dog in various breeds, colors and poses. The traditional applications for medical image analysis were discussed in Section 3. New areas of research include prognostication, content-based image retrieval, image report or caption generation and manipulation of physical objects with LSTMs and reinforcement learning involving surgical robots. An interesting application was reported by Nie et al. , in which GANs were used to generate CT brain images from MRI images. This is remarkable, as it means that patients can potentially avoid the ionizing radiation from a CT scanner altogether, lowering cost and improving patient safety. Nie also exploited the ability of GANs to generate improved, higher resolution images from native images [108] and reduced the blurriness in the CT images.",Deep Learning and Machine Learning,"This review discusses the application of machine learning algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks, in medical image analysis.

26,,Deep learning for electronic health records: A comparative review of multiple deep neural architectures,"Deep learning , Representation learning , Neural networks , Electronic health records , CPRD.","Despite the recent developments in deep learning models, their applications in clinical decision-support systems have been very limited. Recent digitalisation of health records, however, has provided a great platform for the assessment of the usability of such techniques in healthcare. As a result, the field is starting to see a growing number of research papers that employ deep learning on electronic health records (EHR) for personalised prediction of risks and health trajectories. While this can be a promising trend, vast paper-to-paper variability (from data sources and models they use to the clinical questions they attempt to answer) have hampered the field’s ability to simply compare and contrast such models for a given application of interest. Thus, in this paper, we aim to provide a comparative review of the key deep learning architectures that have been applied to EHR data. Furthermore, we also aim to: (1) introduce and use one of the world’s largest and most complex linked primary care EHR datasets (i.e., Clinical Practice Research Datalink, or CPRD) as a new asset for training such data-hungry models; (2) provide a guideline for working with EHR data for deep learning; (3) share some of the best practices for assessing the “goodness” of deep-learning models in clinical risk prediction; (4) and propose future research ideas for making deep learning models more suitable for the EHR data. Our results highlight the difficulties of working with highly imbalanced datasets, and show that sequential deep learning architectures such as RNN may be more suitable to deal with the temporal nature of EHR.","The use of DL to analyse EHR data has increased over the past years; a growth that is continuing to be facilitated by the availability of more data (EHR and beyond), developments in DL (specifically, models for sequential data), and innovative ways of combining these two trends. In this work, we implemented key deep learning architectures to learn an efficient patient representation for predicting emergency admission, and heart failure. Our objective here was to help the field have a comparative view of these approaches, and to assess their strengths and weaknesses when it comes to EHR. Along this work, we introduced CPRD, which is one of the world’s largest primary care databases, and showed how data from primary care can provide predictions that can be of value in policy and practice of care. Given the complexity of primary care EHR (heterogeneous events recorded in irregular intervals with varying degree of richness and quality across different individuals), and its importance in provision of care in many parts of the world, we believe that the set of best practices we shared for them (e.g., inclusion criteria, preprocessing, medical codes/grouping, performance metrics, and hyperparameter tuning) will be of great value in helping DL research in EHR. Our work showed the strength of recurrent neural networks in dealing with the temporal nature of the EHR. This was consistent with the developments in modelling EHR-like data from other domains, such as natural language and time series data. Our future research aims to explore techniques and methodologies from such domains, and apply them to other types of data from different healthcare systems.",Deep Learning and Machine Learning,"The paper discusses the limited applications of deep learning models in clinical decision-support systems despite recent developments in the field.

Currently, 39% of HIV patients are reported to suffer from depression. This population is more likely to experience worsening disease states and, thus, poorer health outcomes. In this study, we analyzed research growth and current understandings of depression among HIV-infected individuals. The number of papers and their impacts have been considerably grown in recent years, and a total of 4872 publications published from 1990–2017 were retrieved from the Web of Science database. Research landscapes related to this research field include risk behaviors and attributable causes of depression in HIV population, effects of depression on health outcomes of PLWH, and interventions and health services for these particular subjects. We identified a lack of empirical studies in countries where PLWH face a high risk of depression, and a modest level of interest in biomedical research. By demonstrating these research patterns, highlighting the research gaps and putting forward implications, this study provides a basis for future studies and interventions in addressing the critical issue of HIV epidemics.","In conclusion, by using bibliometric and scientometric analysis, this study presented the global research trends and interests, pointed out the research gaps of available publications, and suggested several implications for depression of HIV-positive individuals. In spite of the fact that this field has attracted a great deal of attention and been extensively studied, more efforts should be made to fulfill the lack of empirical study in developing countries and biomedical investigation on the correlation between HIV and depression.",Medical Data Analysis,"This study analyzes the research growth and current understandings of depression among HIV-infected individuals, which has become an urgent issue.

28,,Detection and diagnosis of chronic kidney disease using deep learning-based heterogeneous modified artificial neural network,Chronic renal failure Kidney disease Artificial neural network Deep learning Support vector machine Segmentation,"The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) increases annually in the present scenario of research. One of the sources for further therapy is the CKD prediction where the Machine learning techniques become more important in medical diagnosis due to their high accuracy classification ability. In the recent past, the accuracy of classification algorithms depends on the proper use of algorithms for feature selection to reduce the data size. In this paper, Heterogeneous Modified Artificial Neural Network (HMANN) has been proposed for the early detection, segmentation, and diagnosis of chronic renal failure on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) platform. Furthermore, the proposed HMANN is classified as a Support Vector Machine and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with a Backpropagation (BP) algorithm. The proposed algorithm works based on an ultrasound image which is denoted as a preprocessing step and the region of kidney interest is segmented in the ultrasound image. In kidney segmentation, the proposed HMANN method achieves high accuracy and significantly reducing the time to delineate the contour.","This paper presents a deep learning-based Heterogeneous Modified Artifical Neural Network (HMANN) method for the detection of chronic renal disease. There are some noisy and complexity during image segmentation. Therefore, it needs an algorithm to manage missing and noisy values with a classification capability. The Proposed HMANN method reduces the noise and helps to segment the kidney image for the clear identification of kidney stone location. To find a good solution to this problem tested three classifiers: support vector machine, artificial neural networks, and Multilayer perceptron. In this paper, the performed feature reduction with the help of significant results from this study, both to reduce excess fitness and to identify the most significant predictive attributes for CKD. Besides, the new factors have found that classifiers use for more accurate detection of CKD than modern formulation.’",Artificial Neural Network,"This paper discusses the use of machine learning techniques, specifically the Heterogeneous Modified Artificial Neural Network (HMANN), for the early detection and diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) using ultrasound images on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) platform.

29,,Economic impact of HIV/AIDS: a systematic review in five European countries,Economic impact; Costs; VIH/AIDS,"The HIV/AIDS disease represent a priority for all health authorities in all countries and it also represents serious added socioeconomic problems for societies over the world. The aim of this paper is to analize the economic impact associated to the HIV/AIDS in an European context. We conducted a systematic literature review for five different countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and United Kingdom) and searched five databases. Three types of analyses were undertaken: descriptive statistics; quantitative analysis to calculate mean costs; and comparison across countries. 26 papers were included in this study containing seventy-six cost estimates. Most of the studies analyzed the health care cost of treatment of HIV/AIDS. Only 50% of the cost estimates provided mean lymphocyte count describing the patients’ disease stage. Approximately thirty percent of cost estimates did not indicate the developmental stage of the illness in the patients included. There is a high degree of variability in the estimated annual cost per patient of the treatments across countries. There is also a great disparity in total healh care costs for patients with lymphocyte counts between 200CD4+/mm3 and 500 CD4/mm3, although the reason of variation is unclear. In spite of the potential economic impact in terms of productivity losses and cost of formal and informal care, few studies have set out to estimate the non-medical costs of HIV/AIDS in the countries selected. Another important result is that, despite the low HIV/AIDS prevalence, its economic burden is very relevant in terms of the total health care costs in this five countries. This study also shows that there are relatively few studies of HIV costs in European countries compared to other diseases. Finally, we conclude that the methodology used in many of the studies carried out leaves ample room for improvement and that there is a need for these studies to reflect the economic impact of HIV/AIDS beyond health care including other components of social burden.","In summary, this review shows the profound impact that HIV/AIDS-treatment costs have in the countries studied. Our study also shows that the methodology used in many of the studies carried out in this field leaves ample room for improvement. Lastly, although there has been a marked increase in the number of investigations on medical-care costs in recent years, there is still a great amount of work to be done toward applying the social perspective to these cost analyses. In addition to calculating the medical and non-medical costs associated with HIV/AIDS, studies of this nature should reflect the social burden that lies outside the healthcare realm but which nonetheless is borne by persons who are not carriers of the disease. The impact of this disease may fall on society as a whole.",Medical Data Analysis,"This paper analyzes the economic impact associated with HIV/AIDS in a European context by conducting a systematic literature review for five different countries.

After that, all studies related to colon cancer analysis are collected under the field of colon cancer and deep learning, then they are divided into five categories that are detection, classification, segmentation, survival prediction, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Then, the studies collected under each category are summarized in detail and listed. We conclude our work with a summary of recent deep learning practices for colon cancer analysis, a critical discussion of the challenges faced, and suggestions for future research. This study differs from other studies by including 135 recent academic papers, separating colon cancer into five different classes, and providing a comprehensive structure.

31,,A review of statistical and machine learning methods for modeling cancer risk using structured clinical data,"Cancer prediction , Cancer recurrence , Cancer relapse , Data mining , Machine learning , Electronic health records .","Advancements are constantly being made in oncology, improving prevention and treatment of cancers. To help reduce the impact and deadliness of cancers, they must be detected early. Additionally, there is a risk of cancers recurring after potentially curative treatments are performed. Predictive models can be built using historical patient data to model the characteristics of patients that developed cancer or relapsed. These models can then be deployed into clinical settings to determine if new patients are at high risk for cancer development or recurrence. For large-scale predictive models to be built, structured data must be captured for a wide range of diverse patients. This paper explores current methods for building cancer risk models using structured clinical patient data. Trends in statistical and machine learning techniques are explored, and gaps are identified for future research. The field of cancer risk prediction is a high-impact one, and research must continue for these models to be embraced for clinical decision support of both practitioners and patients.","This paper presents a comprehensive review of literature utilizing data mining techniques to perform cancer risk and recurrence prediction. This field is important, as these models can inform patient screening and treatment patterns, potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing overall healthcare costs. The key impact of these models is reducing costs. Governments spend billions of dollars on chronic conditions and acute end of life care. These models can determine who to spend those resources on, and more importantly, who not to spend those resources on. This both improves patient care and reduces operating costs, allowing funds to be spent advancing cutting-edge developments in cancer care. The data provided to these models must be structured, frequently captured, and clinically relevant as to apply to large populations of patients. Coding standards must be enhanced to allow many different clinics and hospitals to exchange structured clinical data. While many standards exist for financial, laboratory, and prescription data, there are gaps in the transfer of point-of-care data such as outcomes and treatment plans. Trends in statistical and machine learning techniques are presented, and analysis is performed to provide several valuable avenues for future work. Many studies utilize statistical survival analysis techniques, such as the Cox Proportional Hazards Model. Those that do not use survival analysis build predictive models using machine learning techniques such as Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines. To propel research in this area, advanced modeling methods using state of the art machine learning techniques must be employed, including time-series analysis, missing data imputation, and feature selection.",Deep Learning and Machine Learning,"This paper reviews current methods for building cancer risk models using structured clinical patient data, exploring trends in statistical and machine learning techniques.

Machine Learning (ML) algorithms provide efficient and effective data analysis models to uncover hidden patterns and other meaningful information from the considerable amount of health data that conventional analytics are not able to discover in a reasonable time. In particular, Deep Learning (DL) techniques have been shown as promising methods in pattern recognition in the healthcare systems. Motivated by this consideration, the contribution of this paper is to investigate the deep learning approaches applied to healthcare systems by reviewing the cutting-edge network architectures, applications, and industrial trends. The goal is first to provide extensive insight into the application of deep learning models in healthcare solutions to bridge deep learning techniques and human healthcare interpretability. And then, to present the existing open challenges and future directions.","As an emerging technique, deep learning has demonstrated tremendous potential in tackling challenging problems in healthcare. In this study, we focused on those problems in healthcare that have been addressed using deep learning with promising results. Deep learning based techniques that have been shown as powerful tools in dealing with disease detection in preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, classification, and clustering steps. The technical aspects of ML and DL architectures were evaluated in this paper by focusing on disease detection in healthcare systems. The performance of these methods was discussed in terms of the accuracy of disease detection and algorithm parameters. Finally, the top architectures of DL methods applied to healthcare were analyzed and discussed. As a summary, we can conclude that hybrid and ensemble methods based on DL produce better accuracy results compared to single techniques. These methods lead to an improvement of the process by combining two or more methods simultaneously and independent of the type of the datasets. On the negative side, deep learning approaches are memory and time-consuming. Hence, designing and applying optimal methods in healthcare systems is an important challenge. In the future, researchers may also put their efforts into developing and integrating efficient technologies to fulfill the hardware requirements of decision making systems including those with a deep neural network structure. As discussed in this paper, to build more effective systems, it is also necessary to improve the structures of the current neural network models. Therefore, to solve complex problems in the healthcare systems, it is necessary to create well-defined architectures that are general and work with different types of health data.

33,,A systematic literature review on obesity: Understanding the causes & consequences of obesity and reviewing various machine learning approaches used to predict obesity,"Obesity Overweight,  Machine learning , Risk factors , Diseases.","Obesity is considered a principal public health concern and ranked as the fifth foremost reason for death globally. Overweight and obesity are one of the main lifestyle illnesses that leads to further health concerns and contributes to numerous chronic diseases, including cancers, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases. The World Health Organization also predicted that 30% of death in the world will be initiated with lifestyle diseases in 2030 and can be stopped through the suitable identification and addressing of associated risk factors and behavioral involvement policies. Thus, detecting and diagnosing obesity as early as possible is crucial. Therefore, the machine learning approach is a promising solution to early predictions of obesity and the risk of overweight because it can offer quick, immediate, and accurate identification of risk factors and condition likelihoods. The present study conducted a systematic literature review to examine obesity research and machine learning techniques for the prevention and treatment of obesity from 2010 to 2020. Accordingly, 93 papers are identified from the review articles as primary studies from an initial pool of over 700 papers addressing obesity. Consequently, this study initially recognized the significant potential factors that influence and cause adult obesity. Next, the main diseases and health consequences of obesity and overweight are investigated. Ultimately, this study recognized the machine learning methods that can be used for the prediction of obesity. Finally, this study seeks to support decision-makers looking to understand the impact of obesity on health in the general population and identify outcomes that can be used to guide health authorities and public health to further mitigate threats and effectively guide obese people globally.","Specific ML approaches can be categorized as either single or hybrid method based on the trends identified in this SLR. As of this writing, the ANN approach is the most often applied ML method in the existing literature. Finally, this SLR also reviewed certain types of diseases related to obesity. The results confirmed that obesity is a healthcare concern and epidemic worldwide and is also well documented as a risk for increasing rates of various other conditions. Therefore, obesity deserves serious consideration and attention from policymakers, healthcare providers, and researchers alike. Obesity prevention must be multifaceted and should actively involve stakeholders at different levels. From potential areas of policy to the development and implementation of these policies, approaches should account for people’s home environments and broad, society-level views of socioeconomic environments. However, many barriers that prevent strategizing on the level of policy alone may be encountered. Instead, the reduction and prevention of obesity will considerably depend on individual lifestyle changes.

A number of state-of-the-art methods have been developed in the past that helped in the automatic segmentation and identification of retinal landmarks and pathologies. However, the current unprecedented advancements in deep learning and modern imaging modalities in ophthalmology have opened a whole new arena for researchers. This paper is a review of deep learning techniques applied to 2-D fundus and 3-D Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) retinal images for automated classification of retinal landmarks, pathology, and disease classification.

Rapid and critical analysis of the three crucial parameters, i.e., abstract, methodology, and the conclusion was done to relate to the model’s possibilities for tackling the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Result: This paper addresses on recent studies that apply ML and AI technology towards augmenting the researchers on multiple angles. It also addresses a few errors and challenges while using such algorithms in real-world problems. The paper also discusses suggestions conveying researchers on model design, medical experts, and policymakers in the current situation while tackling the Covid-19 pandemic and ahead. Conclusion: The ongoing development in AI and ML has significantly improved treatment, medication, screening, prediction, forecasting, contact tracing, and drug/vaccine development process for the Covid-19 pandemic and reduce the human intervention in medical practice. However, most of the models are not deployed enough to show their real-world operation, but they are still up to the mark to tackle the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.","Since the outbreak of the novel SARS-CoV-2, scientists and medical industries around the globe ubiquitously urged to fight against the pandemic, searching alternative method of rapid screening and prediction process, contact tracing, forecasting, and development of vaccine or drugs with the more accurate and reliable operation. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are such promising methods employed by various healthcare providers. This paper addresses on recent studies that apply such advance technology in augmenting the researchers in multiple angles, addressing the troubles and challenges while using such algorithm in assisting medical expert in real-world problems. This paper also discusses suggestions conveying researchers on AI/ML based model design, medical experts, and policymakers on few errors encountered in the current situation while tackling the current pandemic. This review shows that the use of modern technology with AI and ML dramatically improves the screening, prediction, contact tracing, forecasting, and drug/vaccine development with extreme reliability. Majority of the paper employed deep learning algorithms and is found to have more potential, robust, and advance among the other learning algorithms. However, the current urgency requires an improved model with high-end performance accuracy in screening and predicting the SARS-CoV-2 with a different kind of related disease by analyzing the clinical, mammographic, and demographic information of the suspects and infected patients. Finally, it is evident that AI and ML can significantly improve treatment, medication, screening & prediction, forecasting, contact tracing, and drug/vaccine development for the Covid-19 pandemic and reduce the human intervention in medical practice.

37,,Deep Learning and Medical Diagnosis: A Review of Literature,Deep learning; medical diagnosis; segmentation; CNN,"In this review the application of deep learning for medical diagnosis is addressed. A thorough analysis of various scientific articles in the domain of deep neural networks application in the medical field has been conducted. More than 300 research articles were obtained, and after several selection steps, 46 articles were presented in more detail. The results indicate that convolutional neural networks (CNN) are the most widely represented when it comes to deep learning and medical image analysis. Furthermore, based on the findings of this article, it can be noted that the application of deep learning technology is widespread, but the majority of applications are focused on bioinformatics, medical diagnosis and other similar fields.","Deep learning methods have a wide application in the medical field. In this case, medical diagnosis is conducted through use-cases of deep learning networks. As mentioned before, these include detection, segmentation, classification, prediction and other. The results of the reviewed studies indicate that deep learning methods can be far superior in comparison to other high-performing algorithms. Therefore, it is safe to assume that deep learning is and will continue to diversify its uses. The future development of deep learning promises more applications in various fields of medicine, particularly in the domain of medical diagnosis. However, in the current state, it is not evident that deep learning can substitute the role of doctors/clinicians in medical diagnosis. So far, deep learning can provide good support for experts in the medical field. All indicators point towards an even wider use of deep learning in various fields. Deep learning has already found its application in transportation and greenhouse-gas emission control, traffic control, text classification, object detection, speech detection, translation and in other fields. These applications were not so represented in the past. Traditional approaches to various similarity measures are ineffective when compared to deep learning. Based on these findings, it can be suggested that deep learning and deep neural networks will prevail, and that they will find many other uses in the near future.",Deep Learning and Machine Learning,"This review analyzes the application of deep learning in medical diagnosis and concludes that deep learning methods have a wide range of applications in the medical field, particularly in bioinformatics, medical diagnosis, and similar fields.

38,,Deep learning for heterogeneous medical data analysis,"Medical Data Analysis , Deep Learning , Survey.","At present, how to make use of massive medical information resources to provide scientific decision-making for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, summarize the curative effect of various treatment schemes, and better serve the decision-making management, medical treatment, and scientific research, has drawn more and more attention of researchers. Deep learning, as the focus of most concern by both academia and industry, has been effectively applied in many fields and has outperformed most of the machine learning methods. Under this background, deep learning based medical data analysis emerged. In this survey, we focus on reviewing and then categorizing the current development. Firstly, we fully discuss the scope, characteristic and structure of the heterogeneous medical data. Afterward and primarily, the main deep learning models involved in medical data analysis, including their variants and various hybrid models, as well as main tasks in medical data analysis are all analyzed and reviewed in a series of typical cases respectively. Finally, we provide a brief introduction to certain useful online resources of deep learning development tools.","Deep learning is a powerful technology to realize complex medical data analysis tasks. So far, a large number of deep learning models have appeared, from a pure model perspective, some of which may not be new things. The main advantage of deep model is that when the node size of the deep network remains roughly unchanged, more powerful function expression can be obtained by increasing the number of node layers. This capability is often achieved by adjusting network weights and biases. In the process of solving practical problems, such ability can be used to create abstract level representations of static data, sequence data, and decision-making data, etc. Although deep learning has achieved some satisfying results in medical data analysis, it also has problems from different perspectives. For example, most of the learning content of deep structure is only variations of gradient descent algorithms, and some algorithms lack solid theoretical basis and strict theoretical proofs. In addition, deep learning requires considerable skill and experience in trying out the configurations and structures of various deep networks, which involve many variations and a large number of high-dimensional parameters. In addition, in order to better understand the success and failure of deep learning models, appropriate theory should be established to clearly explain the convergence, speed, approximation and other characteristics of learning algorithms, and even to give strict proofs for some contents. Finally, deep learning technology cannot completely replace other technologies. We should also explore the combination of deep learning and traditional models, establish new models and algorithms, and explore and apply a variety of large-scale problems.",Deep Learning and Machine Learning,"This review discusses the application of deep learning in medical data analysis.

39,,DEEP LEARNING TECHNOLOGY FOR IMPROVING CANCER CARE IN SOCIETY: NEW DIRECTIONS IN CANCER IMAGING DRIVEN BY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,"Deep learning, cancer imaging, artificial intelligence, lung cancer, breast cancer, technological paradigm, Amara’s law, Gartner hype cycle, emerging technology, new technology.","The goal of this study is to show emerging applications of deep learning technology in cancer imaging. Deep learning technology is a family of computational methods that allow an algorithm to program itself by learning from a large set of examples that demonstrate the desired behavior. Applications of deep learning technology to cancer imaging can assist pathologists in the detection and classification of cancer in the early stages of its development to allow patients to have appropriate treatments that can increase survival or recovery of patients. Statistical analyses and other analytical approaches, based on data of ScienceDirect (a source for scientific research), suggest that, since the late 1990s, the sharp increase of the studies of deep learning technology in cancer imaging seems to be driven by high rates of mortality of some types of cancer (e.g., lung and breast) in order to solve consequential problems of a more accurate detection and characterization of cancer types to apply efficient anti-cancer therapies. Moreover, this study also shows sources of the trajectories of deep learning technology in cancer imaging at level of scientific subject areas, universities and countries with the highest scientific production in these research fields. This new technology, in accordance with Amara’s law, can generate a shift of technological paradigm for diagnostic assessment of any cancer type and disease. This new technology can also generate benefits for poor regions because they can send digital images to labs of other developed regions to have diagnosis of cancer types, reducing as far as possible current gap in healthcare among different regions.","Deep learning technology has the opportunity to assist pathologists and physicians by improving the efficiency of their work, standardizing quality, and providing better prognostication. Although organizational workflow of pathologists and other physicians is likely to change with deep learning technology, the contributions of pathologists, and in general of humans, to patient care is important, very important to treat diseases. Deep learning technology in oncology, to date, has not been vigorously validated for reproducibility and generalizability of applications in clinical practice. Further research has to determine the feasibility of applying deep learning technology in different clinical settings and to determine whether the use of deep learning technology can improve health care and efficiency of hospitals and research labs. The study here suggests that deep learning technology in oncology can pave a revolution in the management of cancer based on new and effective diagnostic approaches in clinical practice. However, the results and arguments of this study are of course tentative. In fact, analyses here are not sufficient to explain the manifold economic, social and organizational pros and cons of the patterns of deep learning technology in cancer studies, since we know that other factors are often not equal over time and 25 space (cf., Sonntag, 2019). In general, this new technology seems to be subjected to the Amara’s law in which we tend to overestimate the effect of deep learning technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run (Amara, 1984).",Deep Learning and Machine Learning,"This study explores the emerging applications of deep learning technology in cancer imaging, highlighting its potential to improve the detection and classification of cancer in its early stages.

The study acknowledges that the results and arguments presented are tentative and subject to the Amara's law, which suggests that the short-term effects of a new technology may be overestimated while the long-term effects may be underestimated.",Deep Learning and Machine Learning
40,,Exploring HCV genome to construct multi-epitope based subunit vaccine to battle HCV infection: Immunoinformatics based approach,"B cell , T cell epitope , HCV , Immunoinformatics , Molecular docking.","Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the single most common indication for liver transplantation. HCV vaccines eliciting specific T-cell responses, have been considered as potent method to prevent HCV infection. Despite several reports on progress of vaccine, these vaccine failed in mediating clinical relevance activity against HCV in humans. In this study we integrated both immunoinformatic and molecular docking approach to present a multiepitope vaccine against HCV by designating 17 conserved epitopes from eight viral proteins such as Core protein, E1, E2, NS2, NS34A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. The epitopes were prioritized based on conservation among epitopes of T cell, B cell and IFN-γ that were then scanned for non-homologous to host and antigenicity. The prioritized epitopes were then linked together by AAY linker and adjuvant (β-defensin) were attached at N-terminal to enhance immunogenic potential. The construct thus formed were subjected to structural modeling and physiochemical characteristics. The modeled structure were successfully docked to antigenic receptor TLR-3 and In-silico cloning confers the authenticity of its expression efficiency. However, the proposed construct need to be validate experimentally to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile.","This study employs multiple approaches including immunoinformatic to design multiepitope vaccine that could be safe and harbors immunogenic potential which may consequently elicit both sort of responses: innate and adaptive thus contribute for control and prevention of HCV.

41,,Extraction of Significant Patterns from Heart Disease Warehouses for Heart Attack Prediction,"Data Mining, Disease Diagnosis, Heart Disease, Pre-processing, Frequent Patterns, MAFIA (MAximal Frequent Itemset Algorithm), Clustering, K-Means, Significant Patterns.","The diagnosis of diseases is a significant and tedious task in medicine. The detection of heart disease from various factors or symptoms is a multi-layered issue which is not free from false presumptions often accompanied by unpredictable effects. Thus the effort to utilize knowledge and experience of numerous specialists and clinical screening data of patients collected in databases to facilitate the diagnosis process is considered a valuable option. The healthcare industry gathers enormous amounts of heart disease data that regrettably, are not “mined” to determine concealed information for effective decision making by healthcare practitioners. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient approach for the extraction of significant patterns from the heart disease warehouses for heart attack prediction. Initially, the data warehouse is preprocessed to make it appropriate for the mining process. After preprocessing, the heart disease warehouse is clustered using the K-means clustering algorithm, which will extract the data relevant to heart attack from the warehouse. Subsequently the frequent patterns are mined from the extracted data, relevant to heart disease, using the MAFIA algorithm. Then the significant weightage of the frequent patterns are calculated. Further, the patterns significant to heart attack prediction are chosen based on the calculated significant weightage. These significant patterns can be used in the development of heart attack prediction system.","Data mining in health care management is unlike the other fields owing to the fact that the data present are heterogeneous and that certain ethical, legal, and social constraints apply to private medical information. Health care related data are voluminous in nature and they arrive from diverse sources all of them not entirely appropriate in structure or quality. These days, the exploitation of knowledge and experience of numerous specialists and clinical screening data of patients gathered in a database during the diagnosis procedure, has been widely recognized. In this paper we have presented an efficient approach for extracting significant patterns from the heart disease data warehouses for the efficient prediction of heart attack. The preprocessed heart disease data warehouse was clustered to extract data most relevant to heart attack using K-means clustering algorithm. The frequent items have been mined effectively using MAFIA algorithm. Based on the calculated significant weightage, the frequent patterns having value greater than a predefined threshold were chosen for the valuable prediction of heart attack. In our future work, we have planned to design and develop an efficient heart attack prediction system with the aid of these selected significant patterns using artificial intelligence techniques.",Deep Learning and Machine Learning,"This paper discusses the challenges of diagnosing heart disease and the potential benefits of data mining in healthcare.

42,,“Velcro-type” crackles predict specific radiologic features of fibrotic interstitial lung disease,"Fibrotic interstitial lung disease, Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, Velcro crackles, Lung sounds, Breath sounds","Background: “Velcro-type” crackles on chest auscultation are considered a typical acoustic finding of Fibrotic Interstitial Lung Disease (FILD), however whether they may have a role in the early detection of these disorders has been unknown. This study investigated how “Velcro-type” crackles correlate with the presence of distinct patterns of FILD and individual radiologic features of pulmonary fibrosis on High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT). Methods: Lung sounds were digitally recorded from subjects immediately prior to undergoing clinically indicated chest HRCT. Audio files were independently assessed by two chest physicians and both full volume and single HRCT sections corresponding to the recording sites were extracted. The relationships between audible “Velcro-type” crackles and radiologic HRCT patterns and individual features of pulmonary fibrosis were investigated using multivariate regression models. Results: 148 subjects were enrolled: bilateral “Velcro-type” crackles predicted the presence of FILD at HRCT (OR 13.46, 95% CI 5.85–30.96, p < 0.001) and most strongly the Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP) pattern (OR 19.8, 95% CI 5.28–74. 25, p < 0.001). Extent of isolated reticulation (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.62–2.57, p < 0.001), honeycombing (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1. 24–2.83, < 0.01), ground glass opacities (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.29–2.32, p < 0.001) and traction bronchiectasis (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.03–2.32, p < 0.05) were all independently associated with the presence of “Velcro-type” crackles. Conclusions : “Velcro-type” crackles predict the presence of FILD and directly correlate with the extent of distinct radiologic features of pulmonary fibrosis. Such evidence provides grounds for further investigation of lung sounds as an early identification tool in FILD.","In conclusion, we identify that “Velcro-type” crackles not only predict the presence of FILD patterns at HRCT, but are also closely associated to the extent of different interstitial abnormalities in the lung parenchyma. Our finding that individual features of pulmonary fibrosis such as ground glass change and reticulation generate “Velcro-type” crackles warrants further investigation of the role of lung sounds as an early identification tool in FILD. The clinical utility of chest auscultation for assisting diagnosis and clinical management of ILD has been historically hampered by the subjectivity of standard chest auscultation and the poor signal transmission of standard stethoscopes [19]; if electronic auscultation were combined with computerized methods for lung sounds analysis and classification, this cost-effective approach might lead to the definition of an “acoustic signature” of FILD for both diagnostic and prognostic purposes, and this should be a focus of future studies.",Medical Data Analysis,"This study investigated the relationship between ""Velcro-type"" crackles heard on chest auscultation and radiologic features of pulmonary fibrosis on High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT). The study found that bilateral ""Velcro-type"" crackles predict the presence of Fibrotic Interstitial Lung Disease (FILD) and are closely associated with the extent of different interstitial abnormalities in the lung parenchyma. Individual features of pulmonary fibrosis, such as ground glass change and reticulation, were found to generate ""Velcro-type"" crackles. The study suggests that lung sounds could be a cost-effective tool for early identification of FILD if combined with computerized methods for analysis and classification.",Medical Data Analysis

The objective of this review was to summarize evidence to support the validity and reliability of the EQ-5D in cancer, and to provide a catalogue of utility scores based on the use of the EQ-5D in clinical trials and in studies of patients with cancer. A structured literature search was conducted in EMBASE and MEDLINE to identify papers using key words related to cancer and the EQ-5D. Original research studies of patients with cancer that reported EQ-5D psychometric properties, responses and/or summary scores were included. Of 57 identified articles, 34 were selected for inclusion, where 12 studies reported evidence of validity or reliability and 31 reported EQ-5D responses or summary scores. The majority of investigations using the EQ-5D concerned patients with prostate cancer (n = 4), breast cancer (n = 4), cancers of the digestive system (n = 7) and Hodgkin and/or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 3). Mean index- based scores ranged from 0.33 (SD 0.4) to 0.93 (SD 0.12) and visual analogue scale scores ranged from 43 (SD 13.3) to 84 (SD 12.0) across subtypes of cancer. A substantial and growing body of literature using the EQ-5D in cancer that supports the validity and reliability of EQ-5D in cancer has emerged. This review provides utility estimates for cancer patients across a wide range of cancer subtypes, treatment regimens and tumor stage(s) that may inform the modelling of outcomes in economic evaluations of cancer treatment.","The use of the EQ-5D in cancer has increased in recent years, and published studies provide evidence to support its validity and reliability. The broad range of EQ-5D index-based and VAS scores in these studies likely reflects systematic variance attributable to stage of treatment protocols, progression of disease and type of cancer, in addition to patient characteristics such as age. Consistent reporting of statistics that include both mean (SD) and median (IQR) EQ-5D scores in studies of cancer would improve the informational value of studies and better facilitate meta-analyses when appropriate. Only a handful of studies reported HR-QOL values according to stage of disease and level of toxicity. Such estimates are likely to be important to researchers who seek to model cancer-related endpoints in future studies. Thus, there continues to be much opportunity for research using the EQ-5D in cancer that would fill gaps in knowledge relating to values/utility scores associated with cancer stage by type of cancer, common sites of metastates within various types of cancer and common treatment induced toxicities.",Medical Data Analysis,"This review article provides an overview of the use of EQ-5D in cancer patients and summarizes evidence supporting its validity and reliability.

44,,HIV/AIDS in Nigeria: a bibliometric analysis,"Nigeria, HIV/AIDS, bibliometric analysis, impact factor , health policy.","Background: Nigeria is home to more people living with HIV than any other country in the world, except South Africa and India-where an estimated 2.9 million [1.7 million – 4.2 million] people were living with the virus in 2005. A systematic assessment of recent HIV/AIDS research output from Nigeria is not available. Without objective information about the current deficiencies and strengths in the HIV research output from Nigeria, it is difficult to plan substantial improvements in HIV/AIDS research that could enhance population health. The aim of this study was to analyse the trends in Nigeria's SCI publications in HIV/AIDS from 1980 to 2006. Special attention was paid to internationally collaborated works that were identified based on the countries of the authors' affiliation. Methods: A bibliometric analysis regarding Nigerian HIV/AIDS research was conducted in the ISI databases for the period of 1980 to 2006. An attempt was made to identify the patterns of the growth in HIV/AIDS literature, as well as type of document published, authorship, institutional affiliations of authors, and subject content. International collaboration was deemed to exist in an article if any co-author's affiliation was located outside Nigeria. The impact factors in the 2006 Journal Citations Reports Science Edition was arbitrarily adopted to estimate the quality of articles. Results: Nigeria's ISI publications in HIV/AIDS increased from one articles in 1987 to 33 in 2006, and the articles with international collaboration increased from one articles in 1980 to 16 in 2006. Articles with international collaboration appeared in journals with higher impact factors and received more citations. A high pattern of co-authorship was found. Over 85% of the articles were published in collaboration among two or more authors. The USA, as the most important collaborating partner of Nigeria's HIV/AIDS researchers, contributed 30.8% of articles with international collaboration. Conclusion: Nigeria has achieved a significant increase in the number of SCI publications and collaborations in HIV literature from 1987 to 2005. There is need to challenge the status, scientists from Nigeria should forge multiple collaborations beyond historical, political, and cultural lines to share knowledge and expertise on HIV/AIDS.","In summary, Nigeria achieved a significant increase in the number of SCI publications and collaborations in HIV literature from 1987 to 2005. As noted by Katz et al [21], research collaboration is good and should be encouraged. Yet there exists opportunity for improvement in international collaboration. There is need to challenge the status, scientists from Nigeria should forge multiple collaborations beyond historical, political, and cultural lines to share knowledge and expertise on HIV/AIDS. Research has helped to quantify HIV associated morbidity and mortality, identified strategies to improve health of people living with HIV/AIDS, and shown the effectiveness of HIV/AIDS preventive interventions. Furthermore, comparison analyses of HIV/AIDS literature production in Nigeria with other countries from sub-Saharan need to be conducted to obtain a more complete regional picture of the situation. These analyses will provide further support to AIDS researchers, health policy analyst, and librarians or information officers in the sub-Saharan Africa.",Medical Data Analysis,"The abstract describes a study that analyzed the trends in Nigeria's HIV/AIDS research output between 1980 and 2006 using bibliometric analysis.

45,,HIV infection and mental health: Suicidal behaviour – Systematic review,suicidal behaviour; HIV; mental health,"Suicide has long been associated with serious illness generally and HIV specifically. New treatments have affected prognosis in HIV positively, but it is unclear how they impact on suicidal burden (thoughts, self-harm and completions). This review examines all published suicide and HIV data for a definitive account of (1) prevalence of HIV-related suicidality, (2) measurement within studies and (3) effectiveness of interventions. Standard systematic research methods were used to gather quality published papers on HIV and suicide, searching published databases according to quality inclusion criteria. From the search, 332 papers were generated and hand searched resulting in 66 studies for analysis. Of these, 75% were American/European, but there was representation from developing countries. The breakdown of papers provided 12, which measured completed suicides (death records), five reporting suicide as a cause of attrition. Deliberate self-harm was measured in 21, using 22 instruments; 16 studies measured suicidal ideation using 14 instruments, suicidal thoughts were measured in 17, using 15 instruments. Navigating the diverse range of studies clearly points to a high-suicidal burden among people with HIV. The overview shows that autopsy studies reveal 9.4% of deceased HIVþ individuals had committed suicide; 2.4% HIVþ study participants commit suicide; approximately 20% of HIVþ people studied had deliberately harmed themselves; 26.9% reported suicidal ideation, 28.5% during the past week and 6.5% reported ideation as a side effect to medication; 22.2% had a suicide plan; 19.7% were generally ‘‘suicidal’’ (11.7% of people with AIDS, 15.3% at other stages of HIV); 23.1% reported thoughts of ending their own life; and 14.4% expressed a desire for death. Only three studies recruited over 70% female participants (39 studies recruited over 70% men), and six focused on injecting drug users. Only three studies looked at interventions – predominantly indirect. Our detailed data suggest that all aspects of suicide are elevated and urgently require routine monitoring and tracking as a standard component of clinical care. There is scant evidence of direct interventions to reduce any aspect of suicidality, which needs urgent redress.","The studies clearly suggest that participant characteristics may also be relevant and there is a need for sub-analysis. Pre-existing literature shows specific elevated rates of suicidal behaviors among a number of groups represented among HIV positive groups. For example, King et al. shows a 1.5-fold elevation of suicidal risk for gay men. Gender differences are well documented in suicidal risk and variables such as age, drug use and mental illness diagnosis are commonly known as cofactors in suicidal risk. The search may have had limitations in the research terms, yet there were clear gaps in the research database revealed. Only three studies recruited over 70% female participants (39 studies recruited over 70% men), and six studies focused exclusively on IDUs. Furthermore, over 75% of the studies had been implemented in North America or Western Europe with only 1% of studies conducted in Africa. Considering the impact of HIV and AIDS across the globe, this research seems to be overwhelmingly disproportionately focused on the West. As the three studies that focus on Africa illustrate, suicidal thoughts and suicidality are not an exclusively Western experience (Olley et al., 2005; Petrushkin et al., 2005; Sebit et al., 2002). Our detailed data suggest that monitoring and tracking of all aspects of suicidality should be a routine component of clinical care. The review shows notable presence of suicidal thoughts, plans and acts resulting on self-harm as well as death. Given this pervasive prevalence, it is clear that there is a gap in both provision and evaluation of interventions. There is scant evidence of direct interventions to reduce any aspect of suicidality and there is some (again scant) evidence of indirect interventions that may affect suicidality outcomes (such as treatment for HIV infection in the first place).",Medical Data Analysis,"This review examines the prevalence of HIV-related suicidality, measurement within studies, and effectiveness of interventions.

46,,Implementation of Convolutional Neural Network Approach for COVID-19 Disease Detection,"COVID-19 detection, Convolutional Neural Network, Deep learning, Image classification, Medical image processing.","In this paper two novel, powerful and robust Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures are designed and proposed for two different classification tasks using publicly available datasets. The first architecture is able to decide whether a given chest X-ray image of a patient contains COVID-19 or not with 98.92% average accuracy. The second CNN architecture is able to divide a given chest X-ray image of a patient into three classes (COVID-19 vs. Normal vs. Pneumonia) with 98.27% average accuracy. The hyper-parameters of the both CNN models are automatically determined using Grid Search. Experimental results on large clinical datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed architectures and demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can overcome disadvantages mentioned above. Moreover, the proposed CNN models are fully automatic in terms of not requiring the extraction of diseased tissue; which is a great improvement of available automatic methods in the literature. To the best of author’s knowledge, this study is the first study to detect COVID-19 disease from given chest X-ray images, using CNN whose hyper parameters are automatically determined by the Grid Search. Another important contribution of this study is that it is the first CNN based COVID-19 chest X-ray image classification study which uses the largest possible clinical dataset. A total of 1524 COVID-19, 1527 pneumonia and 1524 normal X-ray images are collected. It is aimed to collect the largest number of COVID-19 X-ray images that exist in the literature until the writing of this research paper.","Hyper-parameters are indispensable for deep learning algorithms and are highly effective on performance. Deep learning model is almost equivalent to choosing the most suitable hyper parameter group. However, pairs of parameters are not always sought for the best performance. In such cases, how to move, which hyper parameters will be changed, to what extent, which hyper parameters are in correlation with each other should be investigated, trends should be determined and presented in studies. Recently, hyper-parameter groups that give the best performance are given in studies involving deep learning studies. In some studies, even these parameter pairs are not fully given. The choice of hyper-parameters and how they achieve success are not discussed. This weakens the analysis value and importance of the study. In the deep learning studies I proposed the selection of hyper parameters at certain intervals instead of the intuitive hyper-parameter selection method, and detailed analysis of how the model performance and working time are affected by the hyperparameter change in these intervals, and discussion of the hyper-parameter groups that are correlated with each other, are analysed in relation to the hyper-parameters. It is imperative that parameter analysis section be present in all studies. In my opinion, it is essential to establish such a standard in such an area where we can no longer keep up with the pace. In this paper, two novel and fully automatic studies using deep convolutional neural networks are presented for COVID-19 detection and virus classification. Two novel, powerful and robust CNN architectures are designed and proposed for two different classification tasks using publicly available datasets. The hyper-parameters of both CNN architectures are automatically determined using Grid Search Optimizer method. Detection of COVID-19 disease is achieved with a high accuracy such as 98.92%. Moreover, classification of chest X-ray images into normal, pneumonia and COVID-19 is obtained with satisfying accuracy of 98.27%. Experimental results on large clinical datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed architectures. The results of Task 1 and Task 2 indicate that, to the best of the author’s knowledge, state-of-the-art classification performance is achieved using a large clinical dataset without data augmentation. One of the main contributions of this study to the literature is that a wide variety of data sets have been used. It is aimed to create the largest possible number of X-ray images of COVID-19 that exist in the literature until the writing of this research. A total of 1524 COVID-19 images, 1527 pneumonia images and 1524 normal images have been collected and used for this research. It is believed that thanks to their simplicity and flexibility, the models proposed in this paper can be readily used in practice to help the physicians for diagnosing the COVID-19 disease.",Deep Learning and Machine Learning,"This paper presents two novel and powerful Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for COVID-19 detection and virus classification using chest X-ray images.

47,,Improved Study of Heart Disease Prediction System using Data Mining Classification Techniques,"Data Mining, Heart Disease, Neural Networks, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes.","The Healthcare industry is generally “information rich”, but unfortunately not all the data are mined which is required for discovering hidden patterns & effective decision making. Advanced data mining techniques are used to discover knowledge in database and for medical research, particularly in Heart disease prediction. This paper has analysed prediction systems for Heart disease using more number of input attributes. The system uses medical terms such as sex, blood pressure, cholesterol like 13 attributes to predict the likelihood of patient getting a Heart disease. Until now, 13 attributes are used for prediction. This research paper added two more attributes i.e. obesity and smoking. The data mining classification techniques, namely Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks are analyzed on Heart disease database. The performance of these techniques is compared, based on accuracy. As per our results accuracy of Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes are 100%, 99.62%, and 90.74% respectively. Our analysis shows that out of these three classification models Neural Networks predicts Heart disease with highest accuracy.","The overall objective of our work is to predict more accurately the presence of heart disease. In this paper, two more input attributes obesity and smoking are used to get more accurate results. Three data mining classification techniques were applied namely Decision trees, Naive Bayes & Neural Networks. From results it has been seen that Neural Networks provides accurate results as compare to Decision trees & Naive Bayes. This system can be further expanded. It can use more number of input attributes listed above in table 1 and 2. Other data mining techniques can also be used for predication e.g. Clustering, Time series, Association rules.

48,,Integrative Data Analysis of Multi-platform Cancer Data with a Multimodal Deep Learning Approach,"Multi-platform cancer data analysis, restricted Boltzmann machine, multimodal deep belief network, identification of cancer subtypes, genomic data, clinical data.","Identification of cancer subtypes plays an important role in revealing useful insights into disease pathogenesis and advancing personalized therapy. The recent development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has enabled the rapid collection of multi-platform genomic data (e.g., gene expression, miRNA expression and DNA methylation) for the same set of tumor samples. Although numerous integrative clustering approaches have been developed to analyze cancer data, few of them are particularly designed to exploit both deep intrinsic statistical properties of each input modality and complex cross-modality correlations among multi-platform input data. In this paper, we propose a new machine learning model, called multimodal deep belief network (DBN), to cluster cancer patients from multi-platform observation data. In our integrative clustering framework, relationships among inherent features of each single modality are first encoded into multiple layers of hidden variables, and then a joint latent model is employed to fuse common features derived from multiple input modalities. A practical learning algorithm, called contrastive divergence (CD), is applied to infer the parameters of our multimodal DBN model in an unsupervised manner. Tests on two available cancer datasets show that our integrative data analysis approach can effectively extract a unified representation of latent features to capture both intra- and cross-modality correlations, and identify meaningful disease subtypes from multi-platform cancer data. In addition, our approach can identify key genes and miRNAs that may play distinct roles in the pathogenesis of different cancer subtypes. Among those key miRNAs, we found that the expression level of miR-29a is highly correlated with survival time in ovarian cancer patients. These results indicate that our multimodal DBN based data analysis approach may have practical applications in cancer pathogenesis studies and provide useful guidelines for personalized cancer therapy.","In this paper, we have mainly applied a multi-modal DBN model to perform integrative clustering on multi-platform cancer data. In principle, our model can be also used to predict missing values based on other variables of a cancer patient after clustering the whole dataset. For example, our model can be used to predict drug use for each patient based on available genetic information. As our modal is a probabilistic framework, each new prediction can be associated with a confidence score. A similar strategy has been used in some references to predict missing drug-target interactions by exploiting the intrinsic correlations of previously known interactions.",Deep Learning and Machine Learning,This paper proposes a machine learning model called multimodal deep belief network (DBN) to cluster cancer patients using multi-platform observation data.

To this end, application of machine learning and data mining methods in biosciences is presently, more than ever before, vital and indispensable in efforts to transform intelligently all available information into valuable knowledge. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is defined as a group of metabolic disorders exerting significant pressure on human health worldwide. Extensive research in all aspects of diabetes (diagnosis, etiopathophysiology, therapy, etc.) has led to the generation of huge amounts of data. The aim of the present study is to conduct a systematic review of the applications of machine learning, data mining techniques and tools in the field of diabetes research with respect to a) Prediction and Diagnosis, b) Diabetic Complications, c) Genetic Background and Environment, and e) Health Care and Management with the first category appearing to be the most popular.

50,,Machine learning for assisting cervical cancer diagnosis: An ensemble approach,"Cervical Cancer, Machine Learning.","Cervical cancer remains one of the most prevalent gynecologic malignancies, worldwide. As cervical cancer is a highly preventable disease, therefore, early screening represents the most effective strategy to minimize the global burden of cervical cancer. However, due to scarce awareness, lack of access to medical centers, and highly expensive procedures in developing countries, the vulnerable patient populations cannot afford to undergo examination regularly. A novel ensemble approach is presented in this paper to predict the risk of cervical cancer. By adopting a voting strategy, this method addresses the challenges associated with previous studies on cervical cancer. A data correction mechanism is proposed to improve the performance of the prediction. A gene-assistance module is also included as an optional strategy to enhance the robustness of the prediction. Multiple measurements are performed to evaluate the proposed method. The results indicate that the likelihood of developing cervical cancer can be effectively predicted using the voting strategy. Compared with other methods, the proposed method is more scalable and practical.","In this study, we investigated multiple approaches for cervical cancer and proposed a novel and efficient auxiliary model for the prediction of cervical cancer using a gene sequence module.

51,,Metabolomics and Its Application to Acute Lung Diseases,"metabolites, nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectroscopy, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, environmental exposure, precision medicine, biomarkers","Metabolomics is a rapidly expanding field of systems biology that is gaining significant attention in many areas of biomedical research. Also known as metabonomics, it comprises the analysis of all small molecules or metabolites that are present within an organism or a specific compartment of the body. Metabolite detection and quantification provide a valuable addition to genomics and proteomics and give unique insights into metabolic changes that occur in tangent to alterations in gene and protein activity that are associated with disease. As a novel approach to understanding disease, metabolomics provides a “snapshot” in time of all metabolites present in a biological sample such as whole blood, plasma, serum, urine, and many other specimens that may be obtained from either patients or experimental models. In this article, we review the burgeoning field of metabolomics in its application to acute lung diseases, specifically pneumonia and acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS). We also discuss the potential applications of metabolomics for monitoring exposure to aerosolized environmental toxins. Recent reports have suggested that metabolomics analysis using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) approaches may provide clinicians with the opportunity to identify new biomarkers that may predict progression to more severe disease, such as sepsis, which kills many patients each year. In addition, metabolomics may provide more detailed phenotyping of patient heterogeneity, which is needed to achieve the goal of precision medicine. However, although several experimental and clinical metabolomics studies have been conducted assessing the application of the science to acute lung diseases, only incremental progress has been made. Specifically, little is known about the metabolic phenotypes of these illnesses. These data are needed to substantiate metabolomics biomarker credentials so that clinicians can employ them for clinical decision-making and investigators can use them to design clinical trials.","In summary, we have reviewed the rapidly expanding field of metabolomics and its application to acute lung diseases. Metabolomics is an important component of systems biology that has enormous clinical potential in the development of biomarkers and as a novel approach to understanding disease mechanisms. Metabolomics allows us to generate a snapshot of all the metabolites present in a biological sample, and to follow rapidly changing trends in metabolites over time in a way that cannot be captured by genomics or proteomics. These changes may be monitored by the application of NMR or MS-based approaches. The challenge for the application of metabolomics to acute lung diseases rests with whether it will be able to identify more precise patient phenotypes that are not presently recognized by currently available clinical tools. The extent of the predictive and prognostic value of a given set of metabolites (e.g., biomarker credentials) will be required for optimal patient selection for clinical trials and ultimately for clinical decision making (14, 15) that will be needed to realize precision medicine. To date, urine metabolomics shows promise for rapidly differentiating pneumonia pathogens that is needed for timely antibiotic selection. However, for ARDS, metabolomics data that enable the distinction of susceptible patients and ARDS severity, are lacking. Analytically, there is a need to improve the sensitivity of NMR analysis and its reproducibility across centers. For MS-based approaches, new developing strategies to address the large number of unknown metabolites are being tested. With these challenges in place, we look forward to a future of increasingly sophisticated analyses of biological samples that will enhance our capability for diagnosing and monitoring human lung diseases.",Medical Data Analysis,"The field of metabolomics, which involves analyzing all small molecules or metabolites present within an organism or specific body compartment, is rapidly expanding and gaining attention in biomedical research.

52,,Natural Language Processing of Clinical Notes on Chronic Diseases: Systematic Review,electronic health records; clinical notes; chronic diseases; natural language processing; machine learning; deep learning; heart disease; stroke; cancer; diabetes; lung disease,"Background: Novel approaches that complement and go beyond evidence-based medicine are required in the domain of chronic diseases, given the growing incidence of such conditions on the worldwide population. A promising avenue is the secondary use of electronic health records (EHRs), where patient data are analyzed to conduct clinical and translational research. Methods based on machine learning to process EHRs are resulting in improved understanding of patient clinical trajectories and chronic disease risk prediction, creating a unique opportunity to derive previously unknown clinical insights. However, a wealth of clinical histories remains locked behind clinical narratives in free-form text. Consequently, unlocking the full potential of EHR data is contingent on the development of natural language processing (NLP) methods to automatically transform clinical text into structured clinical data that can guide clinical decisions and potentially delay or prevent disease onset. Objective: The goal of the research was to provide a comprehensive overview of the development and uptake of NLP methods applied to free-text clinical notes related to chronic diseases, including the investigation of challenges faced by NLP methodologies in understanding clinical narratives. Methods: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed and searches were conducted in 5 databases using “clinical notes,” “natural language processing,” and “chronic disease” and their variations as keywords to maximize coverage of the articles. Results: Of the 2652 articles considered, 106 met the inclusion criteria. Review of the included papers resulted in identification of 43 chronic diseases, which were then further classified into 10 disease categories using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. The majority of studies focused on diseases of the circulatory system (n=38) while endocrine and metabolic diseases were fewest (n=14). This was due to the structure of clinical records related to metabolic diseases, which typically contain much more structured data, compared with medical records for diseases of the circulatory system, which focus more on unstructured data and consequently have seen a stronger focus of NLP. The review has shown that there is a significant increase in the use of machine learning methods compared to rule-based approaches; however, deep learning methods remain emergent (n=3). Consequently, the majority of works focus on classification of disease phenotype with only a handful of papers addressing extraction of comorbidities from the free text or integration of clinical notes with structured data. There is a notable use of relatively simple methods, such as shallow classifiers (or combination with rule-based methods), due to the interpretability of predictions, which still represents a significant issue for more complex methods. Finally, scarcity of publicly available data may also have contributed to insufficient development of more advanced methods, such as extraction of word embeddings from clinical notes.","Efforts are still required to improve (1) progression of clinical NLP methods from extraction toward understanding; (2) recognition of relations among entities rather than entities in isolation; (3) temporal extraction to understand past, current, and future clinical events; (4) exploitation of alternative sources of clinical knowledge; and (5) availability of large-scale, de-identified clinical corpora. Finally, our review has reinforced the fact that availability of public datasets remains scarce. This outcome was largely expected given the sensitivity of clinical data in addition to all the legal and regulatory issues, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC) of the European Law (superseded by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679). As a result, the studies reviewed in this paper typically came from research-based health care institutions with in-house NLP teams having access to clinical data. Therefore, the need remains for shared tasks such as i2b2 and access to data that would increase participation in clinical NLP and contribute to improvements of NLP methods and algorithms targeting clinical applications.",Natural Language Processing,"The article discusses the potential of using natural language processing (NLP) methods to extract useful information from electronic health records (EHRs) related to chronic diseases.

The studies focused on diseases of the circulatory system and used machine learning methods for disease phenotype classification. However, deep learning methods and the extraction of word embeddings from clinical notes remain relatively new. The scarcity of publicly available data also limits the development of NLP methods.

To evaluate and tune the architectures we use k-way cross-validation as well as Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) to measure the quality of our classifications. The study is performed on the publicly available Cleveland dataset of medical information, and we are making our developments open source, to further facilitate openness and research on the use of DNNs in medicine.

Pending reviews and publication, we are preparing to release the HEARO software framework as an open source, and HEARO-5 as a benchmark, making the software available for comparison and further facilitating openness and research on the use of DNN techniques in medicine. While the current developments are mostly research with excellent proof-of-concept results, further research and development is necessary in order to turn it into a robust diagnostic tool, e.g., that doctors consult and use routinely to make a more informed diagnosis. Research is needed in the data analytics area and its intersection with data-based medical diagnosis – including automatic search for best features, as well as possible features expansion or features reduction, e.g., due to lack of certain clinical data. Future directions include extending this analysis to construct a more thorough model that includes heart visualizations and CT image data. More features can provide more data for the algorithm to learn from, creating a more complex model and ensuring a more accurate and detailed prediction. Another area of future research would involve using speed optimization tools and accelerated linear algebra backends such as MagmaDNN for GPUs to improve the algorithm’s ability to process large amounts of data and find best configurations in parallel.

For many people, cancer survival today means living with a complex and chronic condition. Surviving and living with or beyond cancer requires the long-term management of the disease, leading to a significant need for active rehabilitation of the patients. In this paper, we present a novel methodology employed in the iManageCancer project for cancer patient empowerment in which personal health systems, serious games, psycho-emotional monitoring and other novel decision-support tools are combined into an integrated patient empowerment platform. We present in detail the ICT infrastructure developed and our evaluation with the involvement of cancer patients on two sites, a large-scale pilot for adults and a small-scale test for children. The evaluation showed mixed evidences on the improvement of patient empowerment, while ability to cope with cancer, including improvement in mood and resilience to cancer, increased for the participants of the adults′ pilot.","Studies have shown that up to two thirds of cancer patients experience substantial physical, psychological and social problems due to the disease and treatment [68]. Support from healthcare and social services is often inappropriate, and patients report high levels of unmet needs following treatment and even a long time after [69].

MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL, DOSS, Embase, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, MedNar, and ProQuest Theses and Dissertations were searched from the inception of the database until June 2012 for any quantitative studies that examined the association between periodontal disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Nineteen studies met our inclusion criteria. Good evidence was found to support an association between these conditions with regard to tooth loss, clinical attachment levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rates. Moderate evidence was noted for C-reactive protein and interleukin-1β. Some evidence for a positive outcome of periodontal treatment on the clinical features of rheumatoid arthritis was noted. These results provide moderate evidence based on biochemical markers and stronger evidence with regard to clinical parameters that common risk factors or common pathologic processes may be responsible for an association between rheumatoid arthritis and periodontal disease. Further studies are required to fully explore both the biochemical processes and clinical relationships between these 2 chronic inflammatory conditions.

Data mining plays an important role in building an intelligent model for medical systems to detect heart disease (HD) using data sets of the patients, which involves risk factor associated with heart disease. Medical practitioners can help the patients by predicting the heart disease before occurring. The large data available from medical diagnosis is analyzed by using data mining tools and useful information known as knowledge is extracted. Mining is a method of exploring massive sets of data to take out patterns which are hidden and previously unknown relationships and knowledge detection to help the better understanding of medical data to prevent heart disease. There are many DM techniques available namely Classification techniques involving Naïve bayes (NB), Decision tree (DT), Neural network (NN), Genetic algorithm (GA), Artificial intelligence (AI) and Clustering algorithms like K-NN, and Support vector machine (SVM). Several studies have been carried out for developing prediction model using individual technique and also by combining two or more techniques.

However, the role of blood biomarkers in RA-ILD is ill-defined. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) levels in RA-ILD patients. The medical records of 84 patients with RA-ILD were retrospectively reviewed. Plasma KL-6 levels were measured by Nanopia KL-6 assay (SEKISUI MEDICAL, Tokyo), using latex-enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay. The median follow-up period was 61 months. Mean age was 61.4 years, 45.2% were men, 44.0% were ever-smokers, and 35.7% showed a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern on high-resolution computed tomography. The median KL-6 level at baseline was 741.2 U/ mL (interquartile range, 439.7–1308.9 U/mL). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, a high KL-6 level (640 U/mL) was an independently associated with a UIP pattern (odds ratio [OR], 5.173; P = 0.005) with old age (OR, 1.104, P = 0.005). On multivariate Cox analysis, a high KL-6 level ( 685 U/mL) was an independent prognostic factor for the mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.984; P = 0.016) with a older age (HR, 1.061; P = 0.030), male sex (HR, 3.610; P = 0.001), lower forced vital capacity (HR, 0.957; P = 0.002), and a UIP pattern (HR, 4.034; P = 0.002).

59,,CONTEXT BASED TEXT-GENERATION USING LSTM NETWORKS," Natural language generation · LSTM networks · Sequence models · language models","Long short-term memory(LSTM) units on sequence-based models are being used in translation,
question-answering systems, classification tasks due to their capability of learning long-term dependencies. In Natural language generation, LSTM networks are providing impressive results on text
generation models by learning language models with grammatically stable syntaxes. But the downside
is that the network does not learn about the context. The network only learns the input-output function
and generates text given a set of input words irrespective of pragmatics. As the model is trained
without any such context, there is no semantic consistency among the generated sentences.
The proposed model is trained to generate text for a given set of input words along with a context
vector. A context vector is similar to a paragraph vector that grasps the semantic meaning(context)
of the sentence. Several methods of extracting the context vectors are proposed in this work. While
training a language model, in addition to the input-output sequences, context vectors are also trained
along with the inputs. Due to this structure, the model learns the relation among the input words,
context vector and the target word. Given a set of context terms, a well trained model will generate
text around the provided context.
Based on the nature of computing context vectors, the model has been tried out with two variations
(word importance and word clustering). In the word clustering method, the suitable embeddings
among various domains are also explored. The results are evaluated based on the semantic closeness
of the generated text to the given context.","The paper discussed about the need for applying contextual information to train language models for text generation
tasks. LSTM networks have been chosen as the language model for the considered use-case. The main focus of the
work is on finding out the best way of extracting context from the sentences, so as to train a text generation model along
with the contexts aiming for a better language model. Multiple methods have been attempted for context extraction and
among those methods, contexts extracted from word clusters in word vector spaces worked better. Also, it has been
clear from the results that the word embeddings generated from the same dataset provided better context vectors. The
evaluation method used cosine similarity measures to calculate the semantic closeness between the generated sentences
and the provided context. The evaluation results also emphasized that context based models perform better compared to
base models. The evaluation method also provided a feedback to the training process to know when the model overfits
so as to stop training the model.",Text generation,"This paper proposes a method for improving the performance of text generation models by incorporating contextual information during training.

relatively long text document by capturing its key information. In the past, supervised statistical machine
learning was widely used for the Automatic Text Summarization (ATS) task, but due to its high dependence
on the quality of text features, the generated summaries lack accuracy and coherence, while the computational
power involved, and performance achieved, could not easily meet the current needs. This paper proposes
four novel ATS models with a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) structure, utilizing an attention-based
bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), with added enhancements for increasing the correlation
between the generated text summary and the source text, and solving the problem of out-of-vocabulary
(OOV) words, suppressing the repeated words, and preventing the spread of cumulative errors in generated
text summaries. Experiments conducted on two public datasets confirmed that the proposed ATS models
achieve indeed better performance than the baselines and some of the state-of-the-art models considered.
","This paper has put forward enhancements to the structure of the attention-based bi-directional LSTM model
(‘Bi-LSTM + Attention’) and the attention-based sequence
model (‘Seq2Seq + Attention’) in order to improve the Automatic Text Summarization (ATS). Firstly, a novel enhanced
semantic network (ESN) model has been proposed, which
works out the semantic similarity between the encoder and
decoder, and maximizes the semantic relevance during training, which increases the probability of generating more accurate text summaries, thus also improving the correlation with
the source text. Secondly, aiming at solving the problem
of unregistered words, a novel ‘DA-PN’ model has been
proposed, which utilizes decoder attention (DA) based on
a pointer network (PN). In addition, simultaneous attention
is paid to both the encoder and decoder, resulting in more accurate text summaries. Thirdly, it has been proposed
to combine the elaborated ‘DA-PN’ model with a coverage mechanism integrating multi-attention. In the resultant
‘DA-PN + Cover’ model, by using the attention distribution
of the encoder and decoder in all the previous time steps,
the attention of the current time step is affected in a positive
way, leading to finding more accurate words for inclusion
in the text summaries by avoiding repeated words. Lastly,
in order to prevent the spread of cumulative errors in generated text summaries, it has been proposed to add a mixed
learning objective (MLO) function [12] to the ‘DA-PN +
Cover’ model. The resultant ‘DA-PN + Cover + MLO’
model is the best performing one among the ATS models
proposed in this paper. It considers the evaluation as a part of
the model iteration along with a global reward, thus further
increasing the readability of generated text summaries.
The performance of the four proposed ATS models was
compared to that of two baselines, ‘Bi-LSTM + Attention’
and ‘Seq2Seq + Attention’, and seven state-of-the-art models, using short-text and long-text corpora. The obtained
experimental results demonstrated the superiority of the elaborated ATS models compared to the baselines and some of
the state-of-the-art models. By using the blended learning
of MLO, the best performing proposed model, ‘DA-PN +

accuracy of automatically generated text summaries by optimization of the evaluation indexes, which could effectively
solve the problem of insufficient attention at the decoder. This

personality lexicon, we analyze the correlations between personality traits and semantic categories
of words, and extract the semantic features of users’ microblogs to construct personality recognition
models using classification algorithms. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the
proposed model can achieve significantly better performances compared to previous approaches.","In this paper, we present an automatic approach to constructing a personality lexicon suitable for personality recognition.
From users’ microblogs, we first extract representative words
using text-mining methods. We then use a clustering algorithm
to separate the representative words into various groups, each
of which is defined as a semantic category. The identified semantic categories form a semantic lexicon as the first Chinese
personality lexicon. During the lexicon’s construction, a main
challenge pertains to how to accurately represent the words. We
use word embedding in a large corpus to obtain original word
vectors, and then use popular Chinese lexicons to refine word
vectors. Based on the personality lexicon, we analyze the correlations between personality traits and word categories, and thereby
enable exploration and interpretation of personality traits using
knowledge of words. The personality lexicon is used to generate
semantic features of words, which are used to train personality
recognition models with the aid of machine learning classifiers.
A large number of experiments are carried out to verify that the
proposed personality recognition model can perform significantly
better compared to previous approaches.
In future, we will utilize distributional contextual representations of the keywords to obtain better word vectors. Furthermore,
the hierarchical clustering and information extraction approaches ill be presented to obtain a personality lexicon with more complicated semantic relations, including hierarchical semantics and
fine-grained semantics of words. This will provide psychologists
with a vital tool to deeply study and interpret personality traits.

69,,Face Recognition Using Laplacianfaces,"Face recognition, principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, locality preserving projections, face
manifold, subspace learning.","We propose an appearance-based face recognition method called the Laplacianface approach. By using Locality
Preserving Projections (LPP), the face images are mapped into a face subspace for analysis. Different from Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) which effectively see only the Euclidean structure of face space, LPP finds an
embedding that preserves local information, and obtains a face subspace that best detects the essential face manifold structure. The
Laplacianfaces are the optimal linear approximations to the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator on the face manifold. In
this way, the unwanted variations resulting from changes in lighting, facial expression, and pose may be eliminated or reduced.
Theoretical analysis shows that PCA, LDA, and LPP can be obtained from different graph models. We compare the proposed
Laplacianface approach with Eigenface and Fisherface methods on three different face data sets. Experimental results suggest that
the proposed Laplacianface approach provides a better representation and achieves lower error rates in face recognition.","The manifold ways of face analysis (representation and
recognition) are introduced in this paper in order to detect
the underlying nonlinear manifold structure in the manner
of linear subspace learning. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first devoted work on face representation and
recognition which explicitly considers the manifold structure. The manifold structure is approximated by the
adjacency graph computed from the data points. Using the
notion of the Laplacian of the graph, we then compute a
transformation matrix which maps the face images into a face
subspace. We call this the Laplacianfaces approach. The
Laplacianfaces are obtained by finding the optimal linear
approximations to the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami
operator on the face manifold. This linear transformation
optimally preserves local manifold structure. Theoretical
analysis of the LPP algorithm and its connections to PCA and

using YOLO","Face Detection, YOLO, Neural Network, object 
detection, Convolutional Neural Network ","Deep learning is nowadays a buzzword and is 
considered a new era of machine learning which trains the 
computers in finding the pattern from a massive amount of 
data. It mainly describes the learning at multiple levels of 
representation which helps to make sense on the data 
consisting of text, sound and images. Many organizations are 
using a type of deep learning known as a convolutional neural 
network to deal with the objects in a video sequence. Deep 
Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) have proved to be 
impressive in terms of performance for detecting the objects, 
classification of images and semantic segmentation. Object 
detection is defined as a combination of classification and 
localization. Face detection is one of the most challenging 
problems of pattern recognition. Various face related 
applications like face verification, facial recognition, clustering 
of face etc. are a part of face detection. Effective training needs 
to be carried out for detection and recognition. The accuracy in 
face detection using the traditional approach did not yield a 
good result. This paper focuses on improving the accuracy of 
detecting the face using the model of deep learning. YOLO 
(You only look once), a popular deep learning library is used to 
implement the proposed work. The paper compares the 
accuracy of detecting the face in an efficient manner with 
respect to the traditional approach. The proposed model uses 
the convolutional neural network as an approach of deep 
learning for detecting faces from videos. The FDDB dataset is 
used for training and testing of our model. A model is finetuned on various performance parameters and the best 
suitable values are taken into consideration. It is also 
compared the execution of training time and the performance 
of the model on two different GPUs.","It can be concluded that processing a huge amount of 
data using deep learning requires a high configuration

GPU is high, then computation of the task can be achieved at 
a faster rate. There are various parameters which are 
responsible for detecting the face from either an image or a 
video. Based on the analysis carried out by the proposed 
model, the following points can be concluded. Firstly, the 
learning rate depends on the network size and size of object 
too. If the network is medium or large and size of object is 
compared to less, then the learning rate should be kept small. 
In our work, the network consists of 18 layers, so the 
calculated learning rate = 0.0001. Secondly, if number of 
times the dataset are trained on the network, better results are 
obtained. It also provokes data overfitting issue so, epoch 
size should be kept at an optimal number which can produce 
neither network overfitting nor underfitting. In our work, 
after 20 epochs it was observed that the IoU accuracy 
obtained is the best i.e 92.2%. Also, resolution of the image 
plays a very important role. Resolution of the image as

As the outbreak of COVID‐19 causes by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) progresses within China and beyond, rapidly available epidemiological data are needed to guide strategies for situational awareness and intervention. The recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China, caused by the SARS‐CoV‐2 emphasizes the importance of analyzing the epidemiological data of this novel virus and predicting their risks of infecting people all around the globe. In this study, we present an effort to compile and analyze epidemiological outbreak information on COVID‐19 based on the several open datasets on 2019‐nCoV provided by the Johns Hopkins University, World Health Organization, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, National Health Commission, and DXY. An exploratory data analysis with visualizations has been made to understand the number of different cases reported (confirmed, death, and recovered) in different provinces of China and outside of China.

In addition, changes and severity of clinical signs often do not correspond to patient-reported symptoms. To better understand the inconsistencies observed between signs and symptoms, we conducted a systematic literature review to evaluate published studies reporting associations between patient-reported symptoms and clinical signs of DED. Methods: PubMed and Embase were searched for English-language articles on the association between clinical signs and symptoms of DED up to February 2014 (no lower limit was set). Results: Thirty-four articles were identified that assessed associations between signs and symptoms, among which 33 unique studies were reported. These included 175 individual sign– symptom association analyses. Statistical significance was reported for associations between sign and symptom measures in 21 of 33 (64%) studies, but for only 42 of 175 (24%) individual analyses.

Hence, betweenness centrality has been heavily applied to discover the most important genes with respect to multiple diseases in biomedicine research. Considering color as a property of graph data to represent different categories for the nodes and edges in the graph, we may investigate the betweenness centrality of each colored subgraph composed of a specific color. However, as investigators may be interested in querying betweenness centrality on multiple combinations of the colored subgraphs, the total execution time on all the subgraphs may be excessively long, considering all the possible combinations. In addition, the performance could be worse when the size of the graph grows larger.

Recently, most research has focused on studying common diseases in the population to reduce death risks, take the best procedure for treatment, and enhance the healthcare level of the communities. Kidney Disease is one of the common diseases that have affected our societies. Sectionicularly Kidney Tumors (KT) are the 10th most prevalent tumor for men and women worldwide. Overall, the lifetime likelihood of developing a kidney tumor for males is about 1 in 466 (2.02 percent) and it is around 1 in 80 (1.03 percent) for females. Still, more research is needed on new diagnostic, early, and innovative methods regarding finding an appropriate treatment method for KT.

The goals of this review article on deep learning in radiology imaging are to summarize what has already been accomplished, determine the techniques used by the researchers in previous years in diagnosing Kidney Tumors through medical imaging, and identify some promising future avenues, whether in terms of applications or technological developments, as well as identifying common problems, describing ways to expand the data set, summarizing the knowledge and best practices, and determining remaining challenges and future directions.","This review gives a deep investigation of recent studies of kidney tumor detection, in which it focuses on the classical machine learning techniques and deep learning approaches built for Kidney Tumors’ early detection based on radiology imaging scans. Furthermore, it covers machine learning techniques, deep learning approaches, and a comparison between Kidney Tumors’ early detection methods. Many studies investigated using databases of just a few images or data sets, and only a few used hundreds and thousands of images. Most of the studies were not comprehensive in covering the entire diagnosis of the tumor. Although many studies performed a predictor model and achieved high results, none implemented multi-models that performed more than one task that covered all tumor diagnosis, detection, segmentation, and classification. In general, deep learning’s application to kidney radiology imaging is still in its infancy. On the other hand, deep learning will continue to progress because it has many advantages over other imaging approaches, and attempts are being made to address the current challenges.

However, predicting preventive or even life-saving medicine for each patient is a non-trivial task. Existing models usually overlook the implicit hierarchical relation between patient’s predicted diseases and medications, and mainly focus on single tasks (medication recommendation or disease prediction). To tackle this limitation, we propose a relation augmented hierarchical multi-task learning framework, named RAHM. which is capable of learning multi-level relation-aware patient representation for reasonable medication stocking. Specifically, the framework first leverages the underlying structural relations of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data to learn the low-level patient visit representation. Then, it uses a regular LSTM to encode the historical temporal disease information for disease-level patient representation learning. Further, a relation-aware LSTM (R-LSTM) is proposed to handle the relations between diseases and medication in longitudinal patient records, which can better integrate the historical information into the medication-level patient representation. In the learning process, two pseudo residual structures are introduced to mitigate the error propagation and preserve the valuable relation information of EHRs.

In order to achieve effective prediction and risk assessment of sports medicine-related diseases, this paper starts with the improved convolutional neural network deep learning algorithm, and adopts the resampling algorithm with self-adjusting function, supplemented by tensor convolution self-coding algorithm. Ural network model assists multi-dimensional data analysis of sports medicine. Finally, in order to build an intelligent medical data platform for sports medicine, this paper innovatively proposes a cloud-based hardware-in-the-loop simulation model. Experiments show that this method provides reference and technical support for the realization of a real cloud-based fusion system.","With the increase of sports medical data year by year, the requirement of data processing and analysis technology is becoming higher and higher. With the huge increase of data, traditional deep learning algorithm appears weak and inefficient in sports medical data mining. Therefore, efficient and precise sports medical data mining methods are very important and meaningful. In order to solve the above problems, this paper systematically analyses and studies the disadvantages of the current convolution neural network algorithm combined with sports medical data, and improves the convolution neural network algorithm based on the resampling algorithm with self-adjusting function.

deep convolution neural network (CNN) was modifed and adapted for person recognition with Image Augmentation (IA) technique depending on gait features. Adaptation 
aims to get best values for CNN parameters to get best CNN model. In Addition to 
the CNN parameters Adaptation, the design of CNN model itself was adapted to get 
best model structure; Adaptation in the design was afected the type, the number of 
layers in CNN and normalization between them. After choosing best parameters and 
best design, Image augmentation was used to increase the size of train dataset with 
many copies of the image to boost the number of diferent images that will be used to 
train Deep learning algorithms. The tests were achieved using known dataset (Market 
dataset). The dataset contains sequential pictures of people in diferent gait status. The 
image in CNN model as matrix is extracted to many images or matrices by the convolution, so dataset size may be bigger by hundred times to make the problem a big data 
issue. In this project, results show that adaptation has improved the accuracy of person 
recognition using gait model comparing to model without adaptation. In addition, 
dataset contains images of person carrying things. IA technique improved the model 
to be robust to some variations such as image dimensions (quality and resolution), 
rotations and carried things by persons. Results for 200 persons recognition, validation

• Improve person recognition by rebuilding implemented methods can be rebuilt with

Accuracy of Deep Learning based Face Recognition","ace recognition, thermal imagery, deep neural
networks, image enhancement","Human-system interactions frequently require a
retrieval of the key context information about the user and
the environment. Image processing techniques have been widely
applied in this area, providing details about recognized objects,
people and actions. Considering remote diagnostics solutions, e.g.
non-contact vital signs estimation and smart home monitoring
systems that utilize person’s identity, security is a very important
factor. Thus, thermal imaging has become more and more
popular, as it does not reveal features that are often used for
person recognition, i.e. sharp edges, clear changes of pixel values
between areas, etc. On the other hand, there are much more
visible light data available for deep model training. Taking it
into account, person recognition from thermography is much
more challenging due to specific characteristics (blurring and
smooth representation of features) and small amount of training
data. Moreover, when low resolution data is used, features
become even less visible, so this problem may become more
difficult. This study focuses on verifying whether model trained
to extract important facial embedding from RGB images can
perform equally well if applied to thermal domain, without
additional re-training. We also perform a set of experiments
aim at evaluating the influence of resolution degradation by
down-scaling images on the recognition accuracy. In addition,
we present deep super-resolution (SR) model that by enhancing
donw-scaled images can improve results for data acquired in
scenarios that simulate real-life environment, i.e. mimicking facial
expressions and performing head motions. Preliminary results
proved that in such cases SR helps to increase accuracy by
6.5% for data 8 times smaller than original images. It has
also been shown that it is possible to accurately recognize even
40 volunteers using only 4 images per person as a reference
embedding. Thus, the initial profiles can be easily created in a
real time, what is an additional advantage considering a solution
setup in a new environment.","This study aimed at verifying whether image resolution
has influence on person recognition task using facial features

evaluated if model trained to extract high frequency components (on RGB images) will be able to generate a meaningful
person embedding from thermal data that is characterized by
blurring and smoothness due to the heat flow in objects. The
preliminary results proved the need to enhance image resolution in order to achieve a high accuracy of person recognition.
The presented Super-Resolution solution allowed to improve
results of person recognition from images downscaled with
bicubic interpolation by 8 % for the resizing scale of 4 on
the IRIS dataset. Yet, for our database that assumed strictly
defined measurement conditions (no movements, volunteer
loking toward the camera) we did not observe any gain of
performance.
Thus, we would like to perform similar research on data
collected by us but during various measuring scenarios, e.g.volunteers turning their head horizontally and vertically. In
future study, we would also like to evaluate the proposed
approach of person recognition on images with original bit

conversion to 8-bit data).",Person recognition,"The study focuses on person recognition from thermal imagery and evaluates the influence of image resolution on recognition accuracy.

Unconstrained environments","Despite the great success of face recognition techniques,
recognizing persons under unconstrained settings remains
challenging. Issues like profile views, unfavorable lighting,
and occlusions can cause substantial difficulties. Previous
works have attempted to tackle this problem by exploiting
the context, e.g. clothes and social relations. While showing
promising improvement, they are usually limited in two important aspects, relying on simple heuristics to combine different cues and separating the construction of context from
people identities. In this work, we aim to move beyond such
limitations and propose a new framework to leverage context for person recognition. In particular, we propose a Region Attention Network, which is learned to adaptively combine visual cues with instance-dependent weights. We also
develop a unified formulation, where the social contexts are
learned along with the reasoning of people identities. These
models substantially improve the robustness when working
with the complex contextual relations in unconstrained environments. On two large datasets, PIPA [27] and Cast In

notable margin, under all splits. On CIM, the new components developed in this work also demonstrated strong effectiveness in raising the recognition accuracy. Both quantitative and qualitative studies showed that adaptive combination of visual cues is important in a generic context and

only about half of the person images containing a frontal
face, the recognition task is very challenging due to the
large variations in pose, clothing, camera viewpoint, image
resolution and illumination. We propose the Pose Invariant
PErson Recognition (PIPER) method, which accumulates
the cues of poselet-level person recognizers trained by deep
convolutional networks to discount for the pose variations,
combined with a face recognizer and a global recognizer.
Experiments on three different settings confirm that in our
unconstrained setup PIPER significantly improves on the

the same dog. We introduced the People In Photo Albums

Among them, we focus on approaches that use multiple labels

are sometimes used to improve the accuracy of the main task
by incorporating extra labels associated with sub-tasks. The
incorporated labels for learning are usually selected from real
tasks heuristically; for example, gender and/or age labels are
incorporated together with subject identity labels. We take a
different approach and consider a virtual task as a sub-task, and
incorporate pseudo output labels together with labels associated
with the main task and/or real task. In this paper, we focus on
a gait-based person recognition task as the main task, and we

we evaluate the efficiency of exGEINet. Experimental results
using the OULP gait dataset showed that not only the labels associated with real tasks but also pseudo labels can contribute
to improved accuracy of gait recognition. Moreover, incorporating multiple extra labels can achieve a further improvement.
In the case where we use labels associated with real tasks,
additional manual annotation or additional information is
necessary, but in the case where we use pseudo labels, we

This is the first step of our research; we only consider
randomly selected pseudo labels, and simply concatenate

of classes in each task is set heuristically. We plan to tackle

The task is technically challenging and practically very useful. For example, businesses always want to find public or consumer opinions about their products and services. Potential customers also want to know the opinions of existing users before they use a service or purchase a product. With the explosive growth of social media (i.e., reviews, forum discussions, blogs and social networks) on the Web, individuals and organizations are increasingly using public opinions in these media for their decision making. However, finding and monitoring opinion sites on the Web and distilling the information contained in them remains a formidable task because of the proliferation of diverse sites. Each site typically contains a huge volume of opinionated text that is not always easily deciphered in long forum postings and blogs. The average human reader will have difficulty identifying relevant sites and accurately summarizing the information and opinions contained in them.

Using movie reviews as data, we find that standard machine learning techniques definitively outperform human-produced baselines. However, the three machine learning methods we employed (Naive Bayes, maximum entropy classification, and support vector machines) do not perform as well on sentiment classification as on traditional topic-based categorization. We conclude by examining factors that make the sentiment classification problem more challenging.","On the other hand, we were not able to achieve accuracies on the sentiment classification problem comparable to those reported for standard topic-based categorization, despite the several different types of features we tried. Unigram presence information turned out to be the most effective; in fact, none of the alternative features we employed provided consistently better performance once unigram presence was incorporated. Interestingly, though, the superiority of presence information in comparison to frequency information in our setting contradicts previous observations made in topic-classification work (McCallum and Nigam, 1998). What accounts for these two differences — difficulty and types of information proving useful — between topic and sentiment classification, and how might we improve the latter? To answer these questions, we examined the data further. (All examples below are drawn from the full 2053-document corpus.)

This method can give high precision, but low recall. To improve recall, additional tweets that are likely to be opinionated are identified automatically by exploiting the information in the result of the lexicon-based method. A classifier is then trained to assign polarities to the entities in the newly identified tweets. Instead of being labeled manually, the training examples are given by the lexicon-based approach.

91,,Review of medical image recognition technologies to detect melanomas using neural networks,"Melanoma classification, Skin cancer, Deep learning neural network, Convolutional neural network, Fuzzy clustering algorithm","Background: Melanoma is one of the most aggressive types of cancer that has become a world-class problem. According to the World Health Organization estimates, 132,000 cases of the disease and 66,000 deaths from malignant melanoma and other forms of skin cancer are reported annually worldwide (https://apps.who. int/gho/data/?theme=main) and those numbers continue to grow. In our opinion, due to the increasing incidence of the disease, it is necessary to find new, easy to use and sensitive methods for the early diagnosis of melanoma in a large number of people around the world. Over the last decade, neural networks show highly sensitive, specific, and accurate results. Objective: This study presents a review of PubMed papers including requests «melanoma neural network» and «melanoma neural network dermatoscopy». We review recent researches and discuss their opportunities acceptable in clinical practice. Methods: We searched the PubMed database for systematic reviews and original research papers on the requests «melanoma neural network» and «melanoma neural network dermatoscopy» published in English. Only papers that reported results, progress and outcomes are included in this review. Results: We found 11 papers that match our requests that observed convolutional and deep-learning neural networks combined with fuzzy clustering or World Cup Optimization algorithms in analyzing dermatoscopic images. All of them require an ABCD (asymmetry, border, color, and differential structures) algorithm and its derivates (in combination with ABCD algorithm or separately). Also, they require a large dataset of dermatoscopic images and optimized estimation parameters to provide high specificity, accuracy and sensitivity. Conclusions: According to the analyzed papers, neural networks show higher specificity, accuracy and sensitivity than dermatologists. Neural networks are able to evaluate features that might be unavailable to the naked human eye. Despite that, we need more datasets to confirm those statements. Nowadays machine learning becomes a helpful tool in early diagnosing skin diseases, especially melanoma.","The analysis of this study leads us to the following statements:  Neural networks in 2019 have greater sensitivity and specificity than dermatologists  A neural network can evaluate features that might be unavailable to the naked human eye  CNN provides the possibility of early detection of signs of melanoma and early treatment  The need for staff training and the purchase of expensive equipment for creating dermatoscopic images can be replaced by software using FC-neural networks By 2019, neural networks show significantly higher sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in comparison with the previous versions and work of dermatologists. The prospect of using this method as an auxiliary and later, perhaps, the main diagnostic is expressed in its increasing availability, accuracy and ease of use. In the age of rapid technology development, information systems and machine learning, the neural network is a learning algorithm that can greatly facilitate and improve the level of accuracy and timeliness of diagnostics.",Medical Data Analysis,"This study is a review of recent research on the use of neural networks in the early diagnosis of melanoma, a highly aggressive type of cancer.

The early detection and prognosis of a cancer type have turned into a major requirement, as it facilitates successive medical treatment of patients. The research team has classified the cancer patients into high or low-risk groups. This makes it a significant task for the medical teams to study the application of deep learning and machine learning models. As a result, such techniques have been employed for modeling the development and treatment of cancer conditions. Additionally, the machine learning tools can have the ability the significant detection features from complex datasets. Numerous techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Bayesian Networks (BN), Decision Trees (DT), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Deep Neural Network (DNN) has been broadly utilized in cancer research. As per the current survey, the detection rate is about 99.89%, which shows the prediction models’ efficiency and precise decision making. However, it is proven that deep learning and machine learning approaches can enhance cancer progression. An adequate level of estimation is required for such approaches for considering the daily medical practice. This survey analyzes and learns the diverse contributions of cancer prediction models using intelligent approaches. Further, the paper tries to categorize the different algorithms, the utilized datasets, and utilized environments. Along with this, various performance measures evaluated in each contribution is sorted out. An extensive search is conducted relevant to machine learning and deep learning methods in cancer susceptibility, recurrence, and survivability prediction, and the existing challenges in this area are clearly described. However, ML models are still in the testing as well as the experimentation phase for cancer prognoses. As the datasets are getting larger with higher quality, researchers are building increasingly accurate models. Moreover, ML models have a long way to go, and most of the models still lack sufficient data and suffer from bias.","This paper has presented a detailed survey of various cancer diagnosis types and prognosis using data mining approaches based on the past ten years’ literature study. This research has also presented the details concerned with diverse machine learning approaches. Furthermore, it has given information about the datasets and simulation platforms used for validating the implemented models. This study has also provided detailed information on the research gaps and challenges concerning the cancer diagnosis and prognosis models through machine learning approaches. Generally, this research gives necessary knowledge related to the traditional cancer prediction system and its approaches that give motivation and many ideas to develop a robust model in the future compared to traditional models. This research gives new researchers a central idea to develop a machine-assisted intelligent model for cancer detection. Still, most of the research discussed in the literature is far behind the maturity in detection accuracy, which needs to be addressed in the future. Thus survey has identified research gaps like the development of pre-clinical trials, handling complex cancer images, precise and early treatment for the clinical opinion, innovative and intelligent strategy in fast detection of disease.

93,,Risk classification of cancer survival using ANN with gene expression data from multiple laboratories,"Microarray , Gene expression , Neural network , Machine learning , Survival analysis , Outcome prediction , Lung cancer.","Numerous cancer studies have combined gene expression experiments and clinical survival data to predict the prognosis of patients of specific gene types. However, most results of these studies were data dependent and were not suitable for other data sets. This study performed cross-laboratory validations for the cancer patient data from 4 hospitals. We investigated the feasibility of survival risk predictions using high-throughput gene expression data and clinical data. We analyzed multiple data sets for prognostic applications in lung cancer diagnosis. After building tens of thousands of various ANN architectures using the training data, five survival-time correlated genes were identified from 4 microarray gene expression data sets by examining the correlation between gene signatures and patient survival time. The experimental results showed that gene expression data can be used for valid predictions of cancer patient survival classification with an overall accuracy of 83.0% based on survival time trusted data. The results show the prediction model yielded excellent predictions given that patients in the high-risk group obtained a lower median overall survival compared with low-risk patients (log-rank test P-valueo0.00001). This study provides a foundation for further clinical studies and research into other types of cancer. We hope these findings will improve the prognostic methods of cancer patients.","The results of this study showed that predicting cancer patients' survival was feasible using cross-laboratory gene expression data. The key to this analysis was identifying the pertinent genes. Previous studies have used data from a single limited source to build a prediction model, and the results might thus have been affected by sample bias. To avoid sample bias, we combined data from several sources to perform the cross-prediction. The majority of previous studies have used methods other than ANN, whereas we used ANN to construct a prediction model and used the sample sets to perform cross-laboratory training and prediction. The results showed that the survival of cancer patients across four hospitals predicted a good performance. However, the predictions showed some inconsistencies across the data sets, which might have been attributable to different medical treatments. Further research and clinical studies are recommended. Other types of cancer should be investigated to improve the prognostic methods of cancer patients.",Medical Data Analysis,"This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of using high-throughput gene expression data and clinical data for predicting cancer patients' survival risk.

94,,Risk of dementia in diabetes mellitus: a systematic review,"Diabetes, dementia, incidence, risk factors, vascular disease, glucose, insulin, amyloid metabolism, comorbidity, epidemiological studies.","The relation between diabetes and major types of dementia is controversial. This systematic review examines the incidence of dementia in people with diabetes mellitus. We identified 14 eligible longitudinal population-based studies of variable methodological quality. The incidence of “any dementia” was higher in individuals with diabetes than in those without diabetes in seven of ten studies reporting this aggregate outcome. This high risk included both Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia (eight of 13 studies and six of nine studies respectively). Detailed data on modulating and mediating effects of glycaemic control, microvascular complications, and comorbidity (eg, hypertension and stroke) were generally absent. The findings of mechanistic studies suggest that vascular disease and alterations in glucose, insulin, and amyloid metabolism underlie the pathophysiology, but which of these mechanisms are clinically relevant is unclear. Further high quality studies need to be initiated, with objective diabetes assessment, together with reliable methods to establish the contribution of vascular disease and other comorbidity to dementia.","There is convincing evidence that shows an increased risk of dementia in people with diabetes, but there are few detailed epidemiological data for risk factors. There are mechanistic studies that provide pathophysiological leads, but do not indicate which of these leads are clinically relevant. This gap in evidence between epidemiological and mechanistic studies needs to be closed. The risk factors and mechanisms that drive the association between diabetes and accelerated cognitive decline and dementia need to be identified before adequate treatment measures can be developed. This process will require longitudinal studies that include detailed assessment of cognition, preferably in combination with neuroimaging, as well as detailed assessment of diabetes-related factors and comorbid conditions. Studies on large population-based cohorts of elderly people with diabetes and longitudinal studies of at-risk populations that examine the progress of vascular disease, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cognition, will be best suited for this approach.",Medical Data Analysis,"This systematic review examines the relationship between diabetes and the incidence of dementia.

Method: PubMed databases were searched for relevant articles. Statistical analyses were conducted to calculate the summary incidence, odds ratio (OR), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by using either random-effects or fixed-effect models. Results: The incidence of all-grade and high-grade (§grade 3) ILD associated with EGFR-TKIs was 1.6% (95% CI, 1.0–2.4%) and 0.9% (95% CI, 0.6%–1.4%), with a mortality of 13.0% (95% CI, 7.6–21.6%). Patients treated with EGFR-TKIs had a significantly increased risk of developing all-grade (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.25– 2.43; P50.001) and high-grade (OR, 4.38; 95% CI, 2.18–8.79; P,0.001) ILD. No significant difference in the risk of ILD was found in sub-group analysis according to EGFR-TKIs, percentage of EGFR mutation, study location, EGFR-TKIs-based regimens, and controlled therapy. Conclusions: Treatment with EGFR-TKIs is associated with a significantly increased risk of developing ILD.","In conclusion, our study has demonstrated that the use of EGFR-TKIs is associated with a substantial risk of developing ILD in patients with advanced NSCLC.

With vast amounts of medical data being generated, there is an urgent need to effectively use this data to benefit the medical and health care sectors all across the world. This survey paper presents a systematic literature review for the investigation of various machine learning techniques used for numerous medical applications which are published in highly reputable venues in recent years. Considering only the recent work, we are able to survey the current machine learning and deep learning models that are being used for medical data. This literature review identifies a clear shift of artificial intelligence techniques used in the medical domain, with deep learning methods taking precedence over machine learning methods.","With the emergence of big data, machine learning techniques are used to learn, analyze, and extrapolate details in the medical research. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the ML techniques including support vector machines, K-means clustering, decision trees, random forests, Naïve Bayes, K nearest neighbors, neural networks, and convolution neural networks, that are being used for various types of medical data and applications in the recent years. A systemic literature review was conducted to search and select research articles from highly reputed and relevant journals in the recent years. The papers selected to survey and document in this survey paper are from journals with a high SJR and google scholar h-5 index. Other criteria like year of publication and number of citations were also taken into consideration in the selection process. Further this survey paper discusses about the current influx of medical data and the challenges that medical data faces with respect to its analysis. Medical data, due to its complex nature, needs intricate analysis techniques. ML techniques, but more recently DL models, have proven to understand medical image, and multi-variate numerical data. More recently, neural networks (and convolution neural networks) have been used for medical image segmentation and classification like brain lesion segmentation, lymph node detection, classification of nodules in human chest from CT scans, brain tumor classification, among many other applications. For other medical applications like medical diagnosis, and dementia prognosis, DL models are also being used more. In fact, for tabular datasets from UCI and KEEL, we have seen applications being shifted from traditional ML techniques to DL. Using empirical evidence, we have concluded that, in the recent years, DL has been preferred more (19 out of 33 papers) by the researchers to work with medical data.

97,,Smartphone use is a risk factor for pediatric dry eye disease according to region and age: a case control study,"Dry eye disease, Pediatrics, Smartphone, Outdoor activity, Video display terminal","Background: In 2014, the overall rate of smartphone use in Korea was 83 and 89.8 % in children and adolescents. The rate of smartphone use differs according to region (urban vs. rural) and age (younger grade vs. older grade). We investigated risk and protective factors associated with pediatric dry eye disease (DED) in relation to smartphone use rate according to region and age. Methods: We enrolled 916 children and performed an ocular exam that included slit lamp exam and tear break-up time. A questionnaire administered to children and their families consisted of video display terminal (VDT) use, outdoor activity, learning, and modified ocular surface disease index (OSDI) score. DED was defined based on the International Dry Eye Workshop guidelines (Objective signs: punctate epithelial erosion or short tear break-up time; subjective symptoms: modified OSDI score) We performed statistical analysis of risk factors and protective factors in children divided into groups as follows: DED vs. control, urban vs. rural, younger grade (1st to 3rd) vs. older grade (4th to 6th). Results: A total of 6.6 % of children were included in the DED group, and 8.3 % of children in the urban group were diagnosed with DED compared to 2.8 % in the rural group (P = 0.03). The rate of smartphone use was 61.3 % in the urban group and 51.0 % in the rural group (P = 0.04). In total, 9.1 % of children in the older-grade group were diagnosed with DED compared to 4 % in the younger-grade group (P = 0.03). The rate of smartphone use was 65.1 % in older-grade children and 50.9 % in younger-grade children (P < 0.001). The mean daily duration of smartphone use was longer in the DED group than controls (logistic regression analysis, P < 0.001, OR = 13.07), and the mean daily duration of outdoor activities was shorter in the DED group than controls (logistic regression analysis, P < 0. 01, OR = 0.33). After cessation of smartphone use for 4 weeks in the DED group, both subjective symptoms and objective signs had improved. Conclusions: Smartphone use in children was strongly associated with pediatric DED; however, outdoor activity appeared to be protective against pediatric DED. Older-grade students in urban environments had DED risk factors (long duration of smartphone use), and a short duration of outdoor activity time. Therefore, close observation and caution are needed when older children in urban areas use smartphones.","In conclusion, increased VDT use such as smartphones or computers in Korean children was found to be associated with the occurrence of ocular surface symptoms. Increased use of smartphones is a serious issue that may result in ocular problems: the prevalence of DED was 6.6 %. The mean duration of VDT use per day, especially smartphone use, was greater in the DED group than in the normal group. Longer daily smartphone use may be a risk factor for DED. The prevalence of DED was higher in the urban group and in older children. Older-grade children in the urban group used smartphones for longer time periods than younger-grade children in rural areas. DED prevalence was higher in older grade children from urban groups compared to younger grade children in rural groups. After cessation of smartphone use for 4 weeks in DED patients, both subjective symptoms and objective signs improved. Therefore, close observation and caution during VDT use, especially smartphones, is recommended for older children in urban areas.

98,,State of the art and a mixed-method personalized approach to assess patient perceptions on medical record sharing and sensitivity,"Sensitive data , Patient preferences , Data sharing , Card sorting , Behavioral health , Electronic medical records.","Objective: Sensitive health information possesses risks, such as stigma and discrimination, when disclosed. Few studies have used a patient’s own electronic health records (EHRs) to explore what types of information are considered sensitive and how such perceptions affect data sharing preferences. After a systematic literature review, we designed and piloted a mixed-method approach that employs an individual’s own records to assess content sensitivity and preferences for granular data sharing for care and research. Methods: A systematic literature review of methodologies employed to assess data sharing willingness and perceptions on data sensitivity was conducted. A methodology was designed to organize and categorize sensitive health information from EHRs. Patients were asked permission to access their EHRs, including those available through the state’s health information exchange. A semi-structured interview script with closed card sorting was designed and personalized to each participant’s own EHRs using 30 items from each patient record. This mixed method combines the quantitative outcomes from the card sorting exercises with themes captured from interview audio recording analysis. Results: Eight publications on patients’ perspectives on data sharing and sensitivity were found. Based on our systematic review, the proposed method meets a need to use EHRs to systematize the study of data privacy issues. Twenty-five patients with behavioral health conditions, English and Spanish-speaking, were recruited. On average, participants recognized 82.7% of the 30 items from their own EHRs. Participants considered mental health (76.0%), sexual and reproductive health (75.0%) and alcohol use and alcoholism (50.0%) sensitive information. Participants were willing to share information related to other addictions (100.0%), genetic data (95.8%) and general physical health information (90.5%).

We examined Sugar Research Foundation (SRF) internal documents, historical reports, and statements relevant to early debates about the dietary causes of CHD and assembled findings chronologically into a narrative case study. The SRF sponsored its first CHD research project in 1965, a literature review published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which singled out fat and cholesterol as the dietary causes of CHD and downplayed evidence that sucrose consumption was also a risk factor. The SRF set the review’s objective, contributed articles for inclusion, and received drafts. The SRF’s funding and role was not disclosed. Together with other recent analyses of sugar industry documents, our findings suggest the industry sponsored a research program in the 1960s and 1970s that successfully cast doubt about the hazards of sucrose while promoting fat as the dietary culprit in CHD.

This hampers their translation to primary care settings through decision support systems. To address this problem, we studied different methods for transforming classifiers into probabilistic/confidence-based predictors (here called uncertainty methods), where predictions are complemented with probability estimates/confidence regions reflecting their uncertainty (uncertainty estimates). We tested several uncertainty methods: two well-known calibration methods (Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression), Conformal Predictors, and Venn-ABERS predictors. We evaluated whether these methods produce valid predictions, where uncertainty estimates reflect the ground truth probabilities. Furthermore, we assessed the proportion of valid predictions made at high-certainty thresholds (predictions with uncertainty measures above a given threshold) since this impacts their usefulness in clinical decisions. Finally, we proposed an ensemble-based approach where predictions from multiple pairs of (classifier, uncertainty method) are combined to predict whether a given MCI patient will convert to AD. This ensemble should putatively provide predictions for a larger number of patients while releasing users from deciding which pair of (classifier, uncertainty method) is more appropriate for data under study. The analysis was performed with a Portuguese cohort (CCC) of around 400 patients and validated in the publicly available ADNI cohort. Despite our focus on MCI to AD prognosis, the proposed approach can be applied to other diseases and prognostic problems.","The main contributions of this work are threefold: • An outright comparison between different methods to target uncertainty of predictions at patient-level, using different classifiers. The analysis was performed with a clinical dataset (CCC), including demographic and neuropsychological tests and around 400 MCI patients. • An ensemble-based approach combining different classifiers and methods to target uncertainty of predictions with the aim of optimizing the quality and quantity of predictions made.

Early diagnosis of PD is crucial to combat against PD to allow patients to deal with it properly. However, there is no medical test(s) available to diagnose PD conclusively. Therefore, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems offered a better solution to make the necessary data-driven decisions and assist the physician. Numerous studies were conducted to propose CAD to diagnose PD in the early stages. No comprehensive reviews have been conducted to summarize the role of AI tools to combat PD. Objective: The study aimed to explore and summarize the applications of neural networks to diagnose PD. Methods: PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) was followed to conduct this scoping review. To identify the relevant studies, both medical databases (e.g., PubMed) and technical databases (IEEE) were searched. Three reviewers carried out the study selection and extracted the data from the included studies independently. Then, the narrative approach was adopted to synthesis the extracted data. Results: Out of 1061 studies, 91 studies satisfied the eligibility criteria in this review. About half of the included studies have implemented artificial neural networks to diagnose PD. Numerous studies included focused on the freezing of gait (FoG). Biomedical voice and signal datasets were the most commonly used data types to develop and validate these models.

This text volume is a precious source of information and knowledge that needs to be efficiently summarized. Text summarization is the method to reduce the source text into a compact variant, preserving its knowledge and the actual meaning. Here we thoroughly investigate the automatic text summarization (ATS) and summarize the widely recognized ATS architectures. This paper outlines extractive and abstractive text summarization technologies and provides a deep taxonomy of the ATS domain. The taxonomy presents the classical ATS algorithms to modern deep learning ATS architectures. Every modern text summarization approach’s workflow and significance are reviewed with the limitations with potential recovery methods, including the feature extraction approaches, datasets, performance measurement techniques, and challenges of the ATS domain, etc. In addition, this paper concisely presents the past, present, and future research directions in the ATS domain.","Text summarization is an old topic, but this field continues to gain the interest of researchers. Nonetheless, the performance of text summarization is average in general, and the summaries created are not always ideal. As a result, researchers are attempting to improve existing text summarizing methods.

103,,Tobacco and tuberculosis: a qualitative systematic review and meta-analysis,Tuberculosis; smoking; second-hand smoke; risk factors.,"To assess the strength of evidence in published articles for an association between smoking and passive exposure to tobacco smoke and various manifestations and outcomes of tuberculosis (TB). Clinicians and public health workers working to fight TB may not see a role for themselves in tobacco control because the association between tobacco and TB has not been widely accepted. A qualitative review and meta-analysis was therefore undertaken. METHODS: Reference lists, PubMed, the database of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease and Google Scholar were searched for a final inclusion of 42 articles in English containing 53 outcomes for data extraction. A quality score was attributed to each study to classify the strength of evidence according to each TB outcome. A meta-analysis was then performed on results from included studies. RESULTS: Despite the limitations in the data available, the evidence was rated as strong for an association between smoking and TB disease, moderate for the association between second-hand smoke exposure and TB disease and between smoking and retreatment TB disease, and limited for the association between smoking and tuberculous infection and between smoking and TB mortality. There was insufficient evidence to support an association of smoking and delay, default, slower smear conversion, greater severity of disease or drug-resistant TB or of second-hand tobacco smoke exposure and infection. CONCLUSIONS: The association between smoking and TB disease appears to be causal. Smoking can have an important impact on many aspects of TB. Clinicians can confidently advise patients that quitting smoking and avoiding exposure to others’ tobacco smoke are important measures in TB control.","The relationship between smoking and TB is important knowledge for clinicians dealing with patients. This association, which has been shown to exist in individual studies and reviews, has not received the attention it merits in terms of TB care standards and research. This systematic review attempts to remedy this situation. Clinicians’ knowledge about a patient’s smoking status or exposure to passive smoking can help them to better manage treatment by providing counselling about stopping smoking. The results of this study show that smokers have greater risks for TB disease and retreatment and some evidence of higher risks for infection and TB disease severity. These results indicate that a clinician can confidently advise TB patients to stop smoking and remain non-smokers or to avoid exposure to others’ smoke in the context of good case management.",Medical Data Analysis,"This article presents a qualitative review and meta-analysis of 42 English articles to assess the strength of evidence for an association between smoking and passive exposure to tobacco smoke and various manifestations and outcomes of tuberculosis (TB).

The Intensive-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) is one of the most important radiotherapies of cancers, especially for Nasopharyngeal cancers, Digestive system cancers and Cervical cancers. For patients, if they can receive the treatment at the earliest possibility while diagnosed with cancers, their survival rate increases. However, the discussion of effective patient scheduling models of IMRT to reduce patients’ waiting time is still limited in literature. This study proposed a mathematical model to improve the efficiency of patient scheduling. The research was composed of two stages. In the first stage, the online stochastic algorithm was proposed to improve the performance of present scheduling system. In the second stage the impact of future treatment to reduce patients’ waiting time was considered. A genetic algorithm (GA) was then proposed to solve the online stochastic scheduling problem. This research collected data from a practical medical institute and the proposed model was validated with real data. It contributes to both theory and practice by proposing a practical model to assist the medical institute in implementing patient scheduling in a more efficient manner.","Several tests are conducted to validate the efficiency of the algorithms. The performance indicators we utilized are objective value, runtime, convergence process and relative improvement. After analyzing the results of different types GA in different problem scales, we observe that AGA performs better than traditional GA, and the performance of local search mechanism is better than FLC in this research. This research contributes to solve the OS scheduling for radiotherapy by considering the two types of patient, i.e. the general patient and the special patient. An adaptive GA is proposed to solve the OS scheduling problem for radiotherapy. In addition, the computational results present that the waiting time of patient could be reduce considering the future scenarios under the base demand. This research has some limitations. For instance, the biological growth of tumors is assumed to be equal among all patients. Also, there is no cancellation mechanism considered. For these limitations, this research can be extended by considering the cancellation mechanism in the OS scheduling problem for radiotherapy, the emergency of patient, and the effectiveness of machine. More types of patients, e.g. existing, new, and referrals, can be considered. Whether and how the AGA algorithm proposed in this research can be improved, this also worth a further study. Additionally, although we looked at the data to ensure that the algorithm did not produce outliers which would result in sacrificing wait times dangerously for one or two patients while optimizing the overall wait time, these algorithms may produce outlier when time limitation is considered, this would also need to examined. Lastly, more metrics could be employed to compare with other research work, and whether this result applies to a clinic which is not currently using an “as soon as possible” method could also be examined.",Medical Data Analysis,"This study proposes a mathematical model to improve the efficiency of patient scheduling for Intensive-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) in Taiwan.

Accurate prediction of HF mortality plays a critical role in evaluating early treatment effects. However, due to the lack of a simple and effective prediction model, mortality prediction of HF is difficult, resulting in a low rate of control. To handle this issue, we propose a Weight-based Multiple Empirical Kernel Learning with Neighbor Discriminant Constraint (WMEKL-NDC) method for HF mortality prediction. In our method, feature selection by calculating the F-value of each feature is first performed to identify the crucial clinical features. Then, different weights are assigned to each empirical kernel space according to the centered kernel alignment criterion. To make use of the discriminant information of samples, neighbor discriminant constraint is finally integrated into multiple empirical kernel learning framework. Extensive experiments were performed on a real clinical dataset containing 10, 198 in-patients records collected from Shanghai Shuguang Hospital in March 2009 and April 2016. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed WMEKL-NDC method achieves a highly competitive performance for HF mortality prediction of in hospital, 30-day and 1-year. Compared with the state-of-the-art multiple kernel learning and baseline algorithms, our proposed WMEKL-NDC is more accurate on mortality prediction Moreover, top 10 crucial clinical features are identified together with their meanings, which are very useful to assist clinicians in the treatment of HF disease.","In this paper, we propose a new MKL prediction model for HF mortality prediction of in-hospital, 30-day and 1-year, i.e., a Weight-based Multiple Empirical Kernel Learning with Neighbor Discriminant Constraint (WMEKL-NDC) method.

employed. Image-based systems yield better results for person 
recognition because they take into account the person's spatial

in this work. On huge annotated datasets like Image Net, recent 
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of features

included to the classification loss for the different pedestrian 
attribute labels. CNN is forced to develop more discriminative 
features that can identify more personally identifiable 
information as a result of combination attribute loss. Using 
traditional metric learning, we further enhance discriminative 
performance on a target identification dataset after extracting 
features from the trained CNN. ","In order to address the issue of appearance-based

Beam Search for Abstractive Summarization","sequence generative models, RNN variants, abstractive document summarization, bidirectional encoder-decoder architecture, bidirectional beam search.","Sequence generative models with RNN variants, such as 
LSTM, GRU, show promising performance on abstractive 
document summarization. However, they still have some issues that limit their performance, especially while dealing 
with long sequences. One of the issues is that, to the best of 
our knowledge, all current models employ a unidirectional
decoder, which reasons only about the past and still limited 
to retain future context while giving a prediction. This makes 
these models suffer on their own by generating unbalanced 
outputs. Moreover, unidirectional attention-based document 
summarization can only capture partial aspects of attentional 
regularities due to the inherited challenges in document summarization. To this end, we propose an end-to-end trainable 
bidirectional RNN model to tackle the aforementioned issues. 
The model has a bidirectional encoder-decoder architecture; 
in which the encoder and the decoder are bidirectional 
LSTMs. The forward decoder is initialized with the last hidden state of the backward encoder while the backward decoder is initialized with the last hidden state of the forward 
encoder. In addition, a bidirectional beam search mechanism 
is proposed as an approximate inference algorithm for generating the output summaries from the bidirectional model.

the final summary one at a time. The experimental results

View Transformation Model", Gait recognition.," Gait recognition is a useful biometric trait for
person authentication because it is usable even with low image
resolution. One challenge is robustness to a view change (crossview matching); view transformation models (VTMs) have been
proposed to solve this. The VTMs work well if the target
views are the same as their discrete training views. However,
the gait traits are observed from an arbitrary view in a real
situation. Thus, the target views may not coincide with discrete
training views, resulting in recognition accuracy degradation.
We propose an arbitrary VTM (AVTM) that accurately matches
a pair of gait traits from an arbitrary view. To realize an
AVTM, we first construct 3D gait volume sequences of training
subjects, disjoint from the test subjects in the target scene.
We then generate 2D gait silhouette sequences of the training
subjects by projecting the 3D gait volume sequences onto the
same views as the target views, and train the AVTM with
gait features extracted from the 2D sequences. In addition,
we extend our AVTM by incorporating a part-dependent view
selection scheme (AVTM_PdVS), which divides the gait feature
into several parts, and sets part-dependent destination views for
transformation. Because appropriate destination views may differ
for different body parts, the part-dependent destination view
selection can suppress transformation errors, leading to increased
recognition accuracy. Experiments using data sets collected in
different settings show that the AVTM improves the accuracy of
cross-view matching and that the AVTM_PdVS further improves
the accuracy in many cases, in particular, verification scenarios.","In this paper, we proposed an AVTM for cross-view gait
recognition. Using this arbitrary-view framework, we eliminated the discrete nature of previously proposed VTMs, and
generated an AVTM. Through the experiments, we showed
that the AVTM achieves higher accuracy than the DVTM,
woVTM, and RankSVM in verification tasks with score normalization and identification tasks. Moreover, we extended
our AVTM to the AVTM_PdVS by incorporating a PdVS
scheme based on the observation that transformation errors
are dependent not only on body parts, but also on destination
views. While the performance of the AVTM was sometimes
worse than that of RankSVM and woVTM in verification
tasks without score normalization because of the inhomogeneous subject-dependent bias of the dissimilarity scores, the
AVTM_PdVS achieved higher accuracy than the comparative
methods including the AVTM in most of the settings for all
tasks.
Moreover, we also showed that the proposed arbitraryview framework improves the accuracy of other approaches
such as RankSVM, which indicates wider applicability
of the arbitrary-view framework. Note that the proposed
AVTM_PdVS still achieves higher accuracy than the arbitraryview version of RankSVM in many settings, which confirms
that the proposed AVTM_PdVS is a promising approach for
cross-view gait recognition.",Person recognition,"This paper proposes an arbitrary view transformation model (AVTM) for gait recognition in person authentication, which addresses the challenge of robustness to view changes.

processing makes automatic text summarization necessary. Currently, pretrained word embedding and sequence to sequence
models can be effectively adapted in social network summarization to extract significant information with strong encoding
capability. However, how to tackle the long text dependence
and utilize the latent topic mapping has become an increasingly
crucial challenge for these models. In this article, we propose
a topic-aware extractive and abstractive summarization model
named T-BERTSum, based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERTs). This is an improvement over
previous models, in which the proposed approach can simultaneously infer topics and generate summarization from social texts.
First, the encoded latent topic representation, through the neural
topic model (NTM), is matched with the embedded representation
of BERT, to guide the generation with the topic. Second,
the long-term dependencies are learned through the transformer
network to jointly explore topic inference and text summarization in an end-to-end manner. Third, the long short-term
memory (LSTM) network layers are stacked on the extractive
model to capture sequence timing information, and the effective
information is further filtered on the abstractive model through
a gated network. In addition, a two-stage extractive–abstractive
model is constructed to share the information. Compared with
the previous work, the proposed model T-BERTSum focuses
on pretrained external knowledge and topic mining to capture
more accurate contextual representations. Experimental results

texts, make full use of self-attention, and judge the importance
of different components of the sentence through different focus
scores. The two-stage extractive–abstractive model can share

relationships between their constituents (words, phrases). Furthermore, BM25 and semantic similarity function are linearly

criterion is applied to re-rank the selected sentences by maintaining query relevance and minimizing redundancy. The proposed method is unsupervised, simple, efcient, and requires no labeled text summarization training data. Experiments are 
conducted using three standard datasets from the DUC evaluation campaign (DUC’2005–2007). The overall obtained results

summarizer does the task of converting the long textual 
document into short fluent summaries. There are generally two 
ways of summarizing text using automatic text summarizer, 
first is using extractive text summarizer and another 
abstractive text summarizer. This paper has demonstrated an 
experiment in contrast with the extractive text summarizer for 
summarizing the text. On the other hand topic modelling is a 
NLP task that extracts the relevant topic from the textual 
document. One such method is Latent semantic Analysis (LSA) 
using truncated SVD which extracts all the relevant topics 
from the text. This paper has demonstrated the experiment in 
which the proposed research work will be summarizing the 
long textual document using LSA topic modelling along with 
TFIDF keyword extractor for each sentence in a text document 
and also using BERT encoder model for encoding the sentences 
from textual document in order to retrieve the positional

entire context of the document to be summarized could not 
be represented in a smaller number of sentences. This could 
work in the case of abstractive summarization as the context 
of multiple sentences could be combined. However, in the 
case of extractive summarization, a greater number of 
sentences are required to represent a large document. We 
aimed to create summaries for large documents, and we have 
overcome the disadvantages of a short summary by 
improving the size of the summary depending on the size of 
the story. 
The CNN/DailyMail dataset had gold standard summaries of 
constant length irrespective of the size of the document to be

this, the proposed model must be run on various datasets 
available having a reference summary of varying lengths. Our 
main goal was to help students who have to go through pages of lectures by providing them with a reliable summary that 
captures the whole context and at the same time reducing the 
size of the document to the optimal length. Thus, the future 
work is to deploy the model on lectures from various massive

unsupervised visual representation learning, which maximize
the similarities between feature representations of different
views of the same image, while minimize the similarities between feature representations of views of different images.
In text summarization, the output summary is a shorter form
of the input document and they have similar meanings. In
this paper, we propose a contrastive learning model for supervised abstractive text summarization, where we view a
document, its gold summary and its model generated summaries as different views of the same mean representation
and maximize the similarities between them during training. We improve over a strong sequence-to-sequence text

125,,Abstractive Text Summarization Using BART," Text Summarization, BERT, BART, Roberta, 
Attention Mechanism, T5","In the last recent years, there's a huge amount of 
data available on the internet, and is generated very rapidly. It 
is very difficult for human beings to analyze and extract useful 
information from huge data especially when the text is large in 
size and longer documents which increases the time to process 
and analyze the data, further it also increases the time taken to 
summarize it. To address this issue automatic text 
summarization is used. Text summarization is defined as 
creating a short, accurate, and fluent summary of a longer 
document. It summarizes the larger text without any human 
intervention. This paper will provide a mechanism where it does 
the text summarization quickly and effectively even for large 
data. We can use this model to summarize and extract important 
information from a large document or text based on our input. 
Here a concept of the Deep Learning model is used for text 
summarization which is called BART (Bidirectional and AutoRegressive Transformer). it consists of both an encoder and 
decoder. The encoder and decoder are merged to form the 
BART algorithm. BERT is trained with a huge amount of 
unlabeled data to achieve the state of art results. The use of an 
attention mechanism in each layer of BERT makes the model 
much more popular as it highlights the important features of the 
input data. BERT performs the masked language modeling with 
the help of its several bidirectional transformer layers and 
predicts the missing values. On the other hand, decoder is used 
to predict the next token in a sentence. Merging both the 
encoder and decoder will form the BART model. Here we will 
compare the BART model with BERT, T5, and Roberta.","Due to the exponential growth of web textual data due 
to the Internet's quick expansion, tasks like paper records, text 
classification, and information retrieval have been
significantly hampered. Summarizing text automatically is a 
very essential way to address this issue. The main function of 
ATS is to automatically create a brief and understandable 
summary by extracting the main ideas from the source text. 
Recently, deep learning-based abstractive summarization 
models have been created in an effort to better balance and 
enhance these two characteristics. This study will present a 
system that can quickly and accurately summarize text, even 
for massive amounts of data. Using our input, utilize this 
method to summarize and extract crucial information from a 
lengthy document or text. Furthermore, a Deep Learning 
model approach known as BART is utilized for text 
summarization. The BART algorithm is created by 
combining the encoder and decoder. Additionally, the 
evaluation of the BART model using BERT, T5, and Roberta 
is shown in the result analysis. In future, this research can be 
extended by analyzing various learning models to improve 
the effectiveness. ",Text summarization,"The exponential growth of web textual data has led to difficulty in analyzing and extracting useful information.

to provide an effective and efficient access to understand an entity by displaying a list of episodes about the entity in chronological order. However,
summarizing the timeline about an entity with social media data faces new challenges. First, key
timeline episodes about the entity are typically unavailable in existing social media services. Second, the short, noisy and informal nature of social media posts determines that only content-based summarization could be insufficient.

Networks for Text Generation","Generative adversarial networks, text generation, deep learning, reinforcement learning"," Text generation is a basic work of natural language processing, which plays an important role
in dialogue system and intelligent translation. As a kind of deep learning framework, Generative Adversarial
Networks (GAN) has been widely used in text generation. In combination with reinforcement learning, GAN
uses the output of discriminator as reward signal of reinforcement learning to guide generator training, but
the reward signal is a scalar and the guidance is weak. This paper proposes a text generation model named
Feature-Guiding Generative Adversarial Networks (FGGAN). To solve the problem of insufficient feedback
guidance from the discriminator network, FGGAN uses a feature guidance module to extract text features
from the discriminator network, convert them into feature guidance vectors and feed them into the generator
network for guidance. In addition, sampling is required to complete the sequence before feeding it into the
discriminator to get feedback signal in text generation. However, the randomness and insufficiency of the
sampling method lead to poor quality of generated text. This paper formulates text semantic rules to restrict
the token of the next time step in the sequence generation process and remove semantically unreasonable
tokens to improve the quality of generated text. Finally, text generation experiments are performed on
different datasets and the results verify the effectiveness and superiority of FGGAN","For text sequence generation, this paper proposes an
improved framework FGGAN. In order to solve the problem
that the feedback signal of the discriminator is not very

a method to create a vocabulary mask based on semantic
rules which restricts the tokens during the generation to make
the sequence more realistic. The superiority of the improved
module is evaluated experimentally. In the synthetic experiment, the negative log-likelihood is used for the evaluation.

advantages including the ability to penetrate obscurants, such as
clothes and polymers. After having explored shape information
retrieved from mmW images for person recognition, in this paper
we aim to gain some insight about the potential of using mmW
texture information for the same task, considering not only the
mmW face, but also mmW torso and mmW wholebody. We
report experimental results using the mmW TNO database consisting of 50 individuals based on both hand-crafted and learned
features from Alexnet and VGG-face pretrained convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) models. First, we analyze the individual performance of three mmW body parts, concluding that:
1) mmW torso region is more discriminative than mmW face
and the whole body; 2) CNN features produce better results
compared to hand-crafted features on mmW faces and the entire
body; and 3) hand-crafted features slightly outperform CNN features on mmW torso. In the second part of this paper, we analyze
different multi-algorithmic and multi-modal techniques, including a novel CNN-based fusion technique, improving verification
results to 2% EER and identification rank-1 results up to 99%.
Comparative analyses with mmW body shape information and
face recognition in the visible and NIR spectral bands are also
reported.","This work has presented one of the very first works addressing person recognition using texture extracted from mmW images. Different mmW body parts have been considered:
face, torso and whole body. We have carried out experiments
with several hand-crafted features and some state-of-the-art
deep learning features. Some of the findings from the experiments are: i) mmW torso is the most discriminative body
part, followed by whole body and face with average EER
of 6.30%, 23.25%, and 29.75%, respectively, ii) mmW face
recognition has very low performance, iii) CNN features overcome hand-crafted features with faces and whole body parts
and, iv) hand-crafted features achieve outstanding results for
torso-based person recognition.
Finding ii) may be explained by the low resolution of
mmW images. Comparative results of face recognition for
visible, NIR and mmW images reported show how the methods proposed in this paper achieve very high recognition
performance for high resolution face images in the visible
region. We believe that this problem could be overcome by
addressing it as a low resolution face recognition problem,
which has been studied deeply elsewhere [32]. The most common techniques are based on super resolution [33] or face
hallucination [34], [35].
The second experimental part of this work has addressed
fusion schemes for multimodal and multi-algorithm
approaches. In what concerns multi-algorithm fusion, in
general, it is convenient to fuse information from all feature
approaches only if individual performances are similar,
otherwise it is better to discard the feature approaches
with worse performance. Regarding multimodal approaches,
the best fusion approach for LBP and HOG features is at
score and feature level, respectively. However, none of the
fusion approaches is able to outperform the best individual
performance achieved with mmW torso. With learned features, CNN level fusion outperforms feature and score level
approaches. In this case, CNN level fusion is able to attain up
to 99% of R1 or 2.5% of EER, when using torso and whole
body mmW body parts.
The best verification results for multi-algorithm fusion is
obtained combining all different texture features extracted
from the torso with an EER of 2%. Regarding multimodal
fusion, the best result is obtained when fusing mmW torso
and mmW whole body at CNN level with Alexnet, reaching a 2.5% of EER. Also, for future work, we will consider
fusing texture with shape (see previous work [7] and texture
information jointly [10]). Also, it would be worth exploring
the possibilities of combining mmW and images from other
ranges of the spectrum [25]. In particular, the results reported
would suggest a fusion of mmW torso and/or the whole body
with visible face images would achieve improved recognition
results.",Person recognition,"The paper explores the potential of using texture information extracted from millimeter wave (mmW) images for person recognition, focusing on three mmW body parts: face, torso, and whole body.

","As an intuitive way of expression emotion, the animated Graphical Interchange Format (GIF) images have been widely used on social media. Most previous studies on automated GIF emotion recognition fail to effectively utilize GIF's unique properties, and this potentially limits the recognition performance. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of human related information in GIFs and conduct human-centered GIF emotion recognition with a proposed Keypoint Attended Visual Attention Network (KAVAN). The framework consists of a facial attention module and a hierarchical segment temporal module. The facial attention module exploits the strong relationship between GIF contents and human characters, and extracts frame-level visual feature with a focus on human faces. The Hierarchical Segment LSTM (HS-LSTM) module is then proposed to better learn global GIF representations. Our proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art on the MIT GIFGIF dataset. Furthermore, the facial attention module provides reliable facial region mask predictions, which improves the model's interpretability.","This study demonstrates the significance of human-related information in GIFs for emotion recognition and proposes a human-centered approach utilizing a Keypoint Attended Visual Attention Network (KAVAN).

Despite their popular applications, the mechanisms of recognizing emotional expressions in cartoon faces are still unclear. Therefore, three experiments were conducted in this study to systematically explore a recognition process for emotional cartoon expressions (happy, sad, and neutral) and to examine the influence of key facial features (mouth, eyes, and eyebrows) on emotion recognition. Across the experiments, three presentation conditions were employed: (1) a full face; (2) individual feature only (with two other features concealed); and (3) one feature concealed with two other features presented. The cartoon face images used in this study were converted from a set of real faces acted by Chinese posers, and the observers were Chinese. The results show that happy cartoon expressions were recognized more accurately than neutral and sad expressions, which was consistent with the happiness recognition advantage revealed in real face studies. Compared with real facial expressions, sad cartoon expressions were perceived as sadder, and happy cartoon expressions were perceived as less happy, regardless of whether full-face or single facial features were viewed. For cartoon faces, the mouth was demonstrated to be a feature that is sufficient and necessary for the recognition of happiness, and the eyebrows were sufficient and necessary for the recognition of sadness. This study helps to clarify the perception mechanism underlying emotion recognition in cartoon faces and sheds some light on directions for future research on intelligent human-computer interactions.","To investigate facial emotional expression recognition in cartoon faces, three experiments were performed in this study. We found that the processing of emotion in cartoon faces showed a happiness advantage and that the highest recognition accuracy was obtained for happy expressions in cartoon faces. In terms of perceived intensity, cartoon faces with sad expressions were perceived as sadder than real faces with sad expressions. Furthermore, facial features showed a dissimilar impact on the recognition of emotional facial expressions, and we highlighted the role of the mouth in happiness recognition and the role of the eyebrows in sadness recognition.

It varies over time, since it is a natural instinctive state of mind deriving from one’s circumstances, mood, or relationships with others. Since emotions vary over time, it is important to understand and analyze them appropriately. Existing works have mostly focused well on recognizing basic emotions from human faces. However, the emotion recognition from cartoon images has not been extensively covered. Therefore, in this paper, we present an integrated Deep Neural Network (DNN) approach that deals with recognizing emotions from cartoon images.

142,,Research on Animated GIFs Emotion Recognition Based on ResNet-ConvGRU,,"Animated Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) images have become an important part of network information interaction, and are one of the main characteristics of analyzing social media emotions. At present, most of the research on GIF affection recognition fails to make full use of spatial-temporal characteristics of GIF images, which limits the performance of model recognition to a certain extent. A GIF emotion recognition algorithm based on ResNet-ConvGRU is proposed in this paper. First, GIF data is preprocessed, converting its image sequences to static image format for saving. Then, the spatial features of images and the temporal features of static image sequences are extracted with ResNet and ConvGRU networks, respectively. At last, the animated GIFs data features are synthesized and the seven emotional intensities of GIF data are calculated. The GIFGIF dataset is used to verify the experiment. From the experimental results, the proposed animated GIFs emotion recognition model based on ResNet-ConvGRU, compared with the classical emotion recognition algorithms such as VGGNet-ConvGRU, ResNet3D, CNN-LSTM, and C3D, has a stronger feature extraction ability, and sentiment classification performance.

143,,"Facial recognition, emotion and race in animated social media",,"Facial recognition systems are increasingly common components of commercial smart phones such as the iPhone X and the Samsung Galaxy S9. These technologies are also increasingly being put to use in consumer-facing social media video-sharing applications, such as Apple’s animoji and memoji, Facebook Messenger’s masks and filters and Samsung’s AR Emoji. These animations serve as technical phenomena translating moments of affective and emotional expression into mediated socially legible forms. Through an analysis of these objects and the broader literature on digital animation, this paper critiques the ways these facial recognition systems classify and categorize racial identities in human faces. The paper considers the potential dangers of both racializing logics as part of these systems of classification, and how data regarding emotional expression gathered through these systems might interact with identity-based forms of classification.","In uniting animation with human representation, animoji and memoji share some similarities with the animated Graphical Interface Format (GIF), or animated GIF (Eppink, 2014; Miltner and Highfield, 2017; Stark and Crawford, 2015). GIFs, too, are racialized: in a brilliant essay, Lauren Michele Jackson observes animated reaction GIFs disproportionately represent Black people, and suggests the mobilization of these expressive objects by white users in particular constitutes a form of “digital blackface” (Jackson, 2017). “Black people and black images are thus relied upon to perform a huge amount of emotional labor online on behalf of nonblack users,” Jackson notes. “We are your sass, your nonchalance, your fury, your delight, your annoyance, your happy dance, your diva, your shade, your ‘yaas’ moments. The weight of reaction GIFing, period, rests on our shoulders.”

Compounding this problem are the ways in which animated reaction GIFs are also codified and classified by businesses like GIF archive and purveyor Giphy, a site exemplary of how animated GIFs are now being monetized through more modulated control of the distribution channels which support the format’s circulation online. By categorizing reaction GIFs and suggesting them through its search function and widely-used API, Giphy is also profiting from animation’s racializing logics. The kind of classificatory mechanics a site like Giphy deploys are seemingly innocuous, but by training and habituating users to consider digital animations as everyday media of social and emotional exchange, Apple and other platforms like it risk codifying and reifying animation as a primary rhetoric of emotional self-expression.

Animated GIFs and animoji/memoji share many formal and aesthetic elements as personalizable forms of lively movement used for social purposes online (indeed, it is no surprise there are now many GIF images of animoji characters, some engaged in “animoji karaoke”). And as Jackson points out, users themselves are often guilty of participating in straightforward “digital blackface.” Yet there are formal qualities of the animated GIF that give the format the potential to be re-radicalized.

A format like the GIF was already widely accessible prior to the commercialization of the World Wide Web and its associated technologies, and so is resistant at a technical level to commodification and capture. Anyone can (and does) create an animated GIF, on any subject. In contrast, Apple and other platforms have technical control over the facial data they collect from users. With animoji and memoji, an animated character ventriloquizes a phone’s user directly, drawing on their attention, physiognomy, and sociality to train Apple’s facial recognition system and collect training data regarding the user’s emotional expressions. At a technical level, animoji and memoji are constrained by racializing classificatory logics in ways an animated GIF is not.

Digital animation — from the hearts and confetti which now appear automatically in the iMessage program on all iPhones to the avatars of games and virtual worlds like The Sims and Second Life — are pervasive across digital worlds. Yet by extension, the modes of emotional and affective labor these formats mediate are suffused with racializing logics, both generated and enabled by these technical formats. What makes such labor suffused with racializing difference is entangled with the history and technical affordances of digital animation as an aesthetic form, digital objects simultaneously interoperable and classifiable, open-ended, and recursive.

There is a resistant or emancipatory potential in animation: it comes in part from what Sianne Ngai terms animation’s “reanimation,” and thus subversion, of stereotypical representations, “images that are perversely both dead and alive” [41]. As facial recognition technologies become widespread, it is vital to turn to explicit philosophies of data justice (Hoffmann, 2018) and design justice (Costanza-Chock, 2018) in the world of digital animation as elsewhere. In accord with other theorists of digital discontinuity, heterodoxy, obfuscation, and queerness (Brunton and Nissenbaum, 2011; Cohen, 2012; Gaboury, 2013; Light, 2011), we need further study of these digital forms of emotional expression, in order to produce “new ways of understanding the technologization of the racialized body” [42]. The racializing tendencies of the digital animate can and must be subverted — but that subversion is unlikely to come from an animated panda calling out in the void. End of article",Person recognition,"The use of facial recognition systems in social media video-sharing applications like animoji and memoji is critiqued in this paper due to the ways in which they classify and categorize racial identities. The paper explores the potential dangers of racializing logics in these systems of classification and how data collected through facial recognition systems may interact with identity-based forms of classification. Animated GIFs and animoji/memoji share many similarities as personalizable forms of lively movement used for social purposes online.

emotion detection and altered neural
processing as faces become more iconic","Iconic faces, Face perception, Emotion, Expressions, P1, Event-related potentials","Iconic representations are ubiquitous; they fill children’s cartoons, add humor to newspapers, and bring emotional
tone to online communication. Yet, the communicative function they serve remains unaddressed by cognitive
psychology. Here, we examined the hypothesis that iconic representations communicate emotional information
more efficiently than their realistic counterparts. In Experiment 1, we manipulated low-level features of emotional
faces to create five sets of stimuli that ranged from photorealistic to fully iconic. Participants identified emotions on
briefly presented faces. Results showed that, at short presentation times, accuracy for identifying emotion on more
“cartoonized” images was enhanced. In addition, increasing contrast and decreasing featural complexity benefited
accuracy. In Experiment 2, we examined an event-related potential component, the P1, which is sensitive to low-level
visual stimulus features. Lower levels of contrast and complexity within schematic stimuli were also associated with
lower P1 amplitudes. These findings support the hypothesis that iconic representations differ from realistic images in
their ability to communicate specific information, including emotion, quickly and efficiently, and that this effect is
driven by changes in low-level visual features in the stimuli.","Iconic faces can be viewed either as analogous to realistic
images or as a distinct class of stimulus. Our findings
support the view that iconic representations serve a distinct
role – to impart specific information quickly and
efficiently – and highlight the advantages of simplifying
image features and increasing contrast to communicate
emotion. In addition, our data suggest that the effects of
iconization may not be specific to faces, but rather to
any stimulus that has these low-level featural changes. It
is thus important to consider that such features are not
just potential low-level confounds but contribute to specific
communicative functions. However, it is unknown if the discrimination of more subtle real-world types of
emotional expression would also benefit from iconic
representation (e.g., the ‘Duchenne’ smile, where genuine
happiness is expressed with the wrinkling of the corners
of the eyes) (Ekman, Davidson, & Friesen, 1990). It may
be that iconic images have a communicative advantage
only for simple visual information, a hypothesis that
invites future research.
The effective communicative role of iconic images may
underlie the ubiquity and popularity of iconic imagery and
cartoons in popular culture. Better understanding of the
factors that enhance their communicative role may help
improve their use in various real-world applications such
as emoticons, signs, and concept cartoons. We suggest
that the communicative role of iconic imagery is an important
area for further research, and its power would be
better exploited than ignored.",Deep Learning and Machine Learning,"The article explores the idea that iconic representations, such as cartoons, may be more efficient at communicating emotional information than realistic representations.

The proposed feature-extraction method, called the Gabor-based kernel partial-least-squares discrimination (GKPLSD), is performed in two consecutive steps. In the first step a set of forty Gabor wavelets is used to extract discriminative and robust facial features, while in the second step the kernel partial-least-squares discrimination technique is used to reduce the dimensionality of the Gabor feature vector and to further enhance its discriminatory power. For optimal performance, the KPLSD-based transformation is implemented using the recently proposed fractional-power-polynomial models. The experimental results based on the XM2VTS and ORL databases show that the GKPLSD approach outperforms feature-extraction methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) or generalized discriminant analysis (GDA) as well as combinations of these methods with Gabor representations of the face images.

MULTIMEDIA CONTENT",,"The paper describes an experimental study on the detection of
emotion from speech. As computer based characters such as
avatars and virtual chat faces become more common, the use of
emotion to drive the expression of the virtual characters become
more important. The study utilizes a corpus containing emotional
speech with 721 short utterances expressing four emotions: anger,
happiness, sadness, and the neutral (unemotional) state, which
were captured manually from movies and teleplays. We introduce
a new concept to evaluate emotions in speech. Emotions are so
complex that most speech sentences cannot be precisely assigned
into a particular emotion category; however, most emotional
states nevertheless can be described as a mixture of multiple
emotions. Based on this concept we have trained SVMs (support
vector machines) to recognize utterances within these four
categories and developed an agent that can recognize and express
emotions.","Compared with KNN, training an SVM model gives a good
classifier without needing much training time. Even if we do not
know the exact pertinences between each feature, we still can
obtain good results. After we produce the SVM model by training
from training data sets, these training data sets are no longer needed since the SVM model contains all the useful information.
So classification does not need much time, and almost can be
applied within real-time rendering. The KNN rule relies on a
distance metric to perform classification, it is expected that
changing this metric will yield different and possibly better results.
Intuitively, one should weigh each feature according to how well
it correlates with the correct classification. But in our
investigation, those features are not irrelevant to each other. The
performance landscape in this metric space is quite rugged and
optimization is likely expensive. SVM can handle this problem
well. We need not know the relationships within each feature pair
and the dimensionality of each feature.
Compared with NNs, training a SVM model will require
much less time than training an NN classifier. And SVM is much
more robust than NN. In our application, the corpus is coming
from movies and teleplays. There are many speakers with various
backgrounds. In this kind of instance NNs do not work well.
The most important reason why we chose SVMs is that SVMs
give a magnitude for recognition. We need this magnitude for
synthesizing expressions with different degrees. For our future
work, we plan to study the effectiveness of our current approach
on data from different languages and cultures.",Natural Language Processing,"The paper presents an experimental study on detecting emotions from speech for use in driving the expression of computer-based characters such as avatars and virtual chat faces.

154,,Emotion Detection for Social Robots Based on NLP Transformers and an Emotion Ontology,social robots; natural language processing; ontology; emotion detection; text classification,"For social robots, knowledge regarding human emotional states is an essential part of adapting their behavior or associating emotions to other entities. Robots gather the information from which emotion detection is processed via different media, such as text, speech, images, or videos. The multimedia content is then properly processed to recognize emotions/sentiments, for example, by analyzing faces and postures in images/videos based on machine learning techniques or by converting speech into text to perform emotion detection with natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Keeping this information in semantic repositories offers a wide range of possibilities for implementing smart applications. We propose a framework to allow social robots to detect emotions and to store this information in a semantic repository, based on EMONTO (an EMotion ONTOlogy), and in the first figure or table caption. Please define if appropriate. an ontology to represent emotions. As a proof-of-concept, we develop a first version of this framework focused on emotion detection in text, which can be obtained directly as text or by converting speech to text. We tested the implementation with a case study of tour-guide robots for museums that rely on a speech-to-text converter based on the Google Application Programming Interface (API) and a Python library, a neural network to label the emotions in texts based on NLP transformers, and EMONTO integrated with an ontology for museums; thus, it is possible to register the emotions that artworks produce in visitors. We evaluate the classification model, obtaining equivalent results compared with a state-of-the-art transformer-based model and with a clear roadmap for improvement.","The need for interaction between machines and humans is becoming more common in people’s daily lives. The effort to improve these relationships through the interpretation of social behaviors are more and more frequent among research developed in the area of social robotics. The interpretation of the feelings of a human being is an important tool that a robot must know how to use to enact correct behavior in a social environment. Our framework is a clear contribution in this area, since it allows robots to interpret a person’s basic feelings and emotion recognition algorithms. Besides that, the information gathered by the robots and the outputs of the classification process can finally be organized in an ontology, leading to more complex analyses and uses of the data. The results obtained with a first implementation of our framework, as a proof-of-concept, show that the integration of speech-to-text and emotion detection algorithms with an ontology was a success despite the fact that there is still the possibility of being improved.
Our future research is focused on improvements of the framework, starting with the suggestions from Section 6 to provide a robust architecture in the community to develop third-party applications in social robotics. We realize the need to incorporate more interpretation characteristics that can complement the detection of a person’s feelings in our framework, such as detection of the face, posture, and context in which the person is involved. Thus, a new classification model that integrates all these characteristics to have more veracity in detecting the feeling will be developed. Once this extension is done, we could make another comparison to Megatron-LM to put in perspective how much value these new features add to our framework. In addition, the framework could be part of an autonomous navigation system applied to a social robot, which would complement decision-making in these processes as well as assuming better socially acceptable behavior towards humans.",Natural Language Processing,"The paper describes a framework for social robots to detect and store emotions in a semantic repository, using an ontology called EMONTO.

160,,Facial expression recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks: Coping with few data and the training sample order,,"Facial expression recognition has been an active research area in the past 10 years, with growing application areas including avatar animation, neuromarketing and sociable robots. The recognition of facial expressions is not an easy problem for machine learning methods, since people can vary significantly in the way they show their expressions. Even images of the same person in the same facial expression can vary in brightness, background and pose, and these variations are emphasized if considering different subjects (because of variations in shape, ethnicity among others). Although facial expression recognition is very studied in the literature, few works perform fair evaluation avoiding mixing subjects while training and testing the proposed algorithms. Hence, facial expression recognition is still a challenging problem in computer vision. In this work, we propose a simple solution for facial expression recognition that uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Network and specific image pre-processing steps. Convolutional Neural Networks achieve better accuracy with big data. However, there are no publicly available datasets with sufficient data for facial expression recognition with deep architectures. Therefore, to tackle the problem, we apply some pre-processing techniques to extract only expression specific features from a face image and explore the presentation order of the samples during training. The experiments employed to evaluate our technique were carried out using three largely used public databases (CK+, JAFFE and BU-3DFE). A study of the impact of each image pre-processing operation in the accuracy rate is presented. The proposed method: achieves competitive results when compared with other facial expression recognition methods – 96.76% of accuracy in the CK+ database – it is fast to train, and it allows for real time facial expression recognition with standard computers.","In this paper, we propose a facial expression recognition system that uses a combination of standard methods, like Convolutional Neural Network and specific image pre-processing steps. Experiments showed that the combination of the normalization procedures improve significantly the method's accuracy.

Traditional approaches for this problem rely on hand-crafted features such as SIFT, HOG, and LBP, followed by a classifier trained on a database of images or videos. Most of these works perform reasonably well on datasets of images captured in a controlled condition but fail to perform as well on more challenging datasets with more image variation and partial faces. In recent years, several works proposed an end-to-end framework for facial expression recognition using deep learning models. Despite the better performance of these works, there are still much room for improvement.

Mixed-model logistic regressions revealed a small but highly signifcant change with age, mainly
driven by changes in the ability to identify anger and fear. Adult-level of performance was reached
between 14 and 15 years of age. Also, across ages, female participants obtained better scores than
male participants, with no signifcant interaction between age and sex efects. These results expand

This ability emerges early on in infancy and continues to refine throughout childhood and adolescence. The ability to identify emotions from non-verbal behavior is related to academic achievement, peer-rated popularity, quality of relationship with adults, and is independent of IQ. Alteration of emotion processing in this age range has also been linked to a variety of developmental disorders such as autism, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, social anxiety, psychopathy, or conduct disorder. Most of the existing research has focused on the perception of static facial expressions, but some studies have explored the development of emotion recognition in the auditory modality. Infants can discriminate affect from tone of voice or from composite face-voice stimuli earlier than from faces alone, and studies focusing on childhood have shown that children as young as four years old can label the emotions expressed by unfamiliar adults from their tone of voice. However, it is unclear whether emotional voice processing is adult-like at the end of childhood or whether maturation still occurs during adolescence.

Neuroscience","In psychology and neuroscience it is common to describe cognitive systems as input/output devices where perceptual and motor functions are implemented in a purely feedforward, open-loop fashion. On this view, perception and action are often seen as encapsulated modules with limited interaction between them. While embodied and enactive approaches to cognitive science have challenged the idealisation of the brain as an input/output device, we argue that even the more recent attempts to model systems using closed-loop architectures still heavily rely on a strong separation between motor and perceptual functions. Previously, we have suggested that the mainstream notion of modularity strongly resonates with the separation principle of control theory. In this work we present a minimal model of a sensorimotor loop implementing an architecture based on the separation principle. We link this to popular formulations of perception and action in the cognitive sciences, and show its limitations when, for instance, external forces are not modelled by an agent. These forces can be seen as variables that an agent cannot directly control, i.e., a perturbation from the environment or an interference caused by other agents. As an alternative approach inspired by embodied cognitive science, we then propose a nonmodular architecture based on active inference. We demonstrate the robustness of this architecture to unknown external inputs and show that the mechanism with which this is achieved in linear models is equivalent to integral control.","The traditional view of cognitive systems as input/output devices with limited interaction between perception and action has been challenged by embodied and enactive approaches.

Personality is an important psychological construct accounting for individual differences in people. Computational personality recognition from online social networks is gaining increased research attention in recent years. However, the majority of existing methodologies mainly focused on human-designed shallow statistical features and didn’t make full use of the rich semantic information in user-generated texts, while those texts are exactly the most direct way for people to translate their internal thoughts and emotions into a form that others can understand. This paper proposes a deep learning-based approach for personality recognition from text posts of online social network users. We first utilize a hierarchical deep neural network composed of our newly designed AttRCNN structure and a variant of the Inception structure to learn the deep semantic features of each user’s text posts. Then we concatenate the deep semantic features with the statistical linguistic features obtained directly from the text posts, and feed them into traditional regression algorithms to predict the real-valued Big Five personality scores. Experimental results show that the deep semantic feature vectors learned from our proposed neural network are more effective than the other four kinds of non-trivial baseline features; the approach that utilizes the concatenation of our deep semantic features and the statistical linguistic features as the input of the gradient boosting regression algorithm achieves the lowest average prediction error among all the approaches tested by us.","   Computational personality recognition is an emerging research field that consists of the automatic inference of users’ personality traits from publicly available information on online social platforms.

Recognition Using Social
Network Context"," Face recognition; graphical models; social
network context; structured prediction"," Personal photographs are being captured in
digital form at an accelerating rate, and our computational
tools for searching, browsing, and sharing these photos are
struggling to keep pace. One promising approach is automatic
face recognition, which would allow photos to be organized by
the identities of the individuals they contain. However,
achieving accurate recognition at the scale of the Web requires
discriminating among hundreds of millions of individuals and
would seem to be a daunting task. This paper argues that social
network context may be the key for large-scale face recognition to succeed. Many personal photographs are shared on the
Web through online social network sites, and we can leverage
the resources and structure of such social networks to improve
face recognition rates on the images shared. Drawing upon real
photo collections from volunteers who are members of a
popular online social network, we asses the availability of
resources to improve face recognition and discuss techniques
for applying these resources"," To advance the state of
the art in face recognition, the questions of how best to
apply these data and how to build scalable recognition
systems are worthy of attention. This paper argues that
social network context is an important tool for assembling
scalable recognition systems, and it provides an example of
a simple computational architecture for utilizing this contextual information.
We have only begun to consider the wide variety of
social signals that are readily available from Facebook and
other online social networks to improve recognition, and
additional sources of information will undoubtedly provide
a far bigger boost in recognition accuracy than we observed
in this small study. Photo timestamps, gender information,
individuals’ names [50] and positions within a photo [21],
scene context [51]–[55], and various sources of within album information [16]–[20], [56] are all immediate
possibilities.
In order to put all of this information to use, it will
likely be beneficial to move beyond the simple pairwise
MRF structure described in this paper. For example, one
might build graphs that span multiple photos to jointly
recognize individuals over a short stretch of time or an
entire event, and hierarchical models might capture
group effects caused by shared affiliations having salient
visual signatures (soccer teams, outdoor clubs, cultural
societies, etc.).
In all of these cases, the increased complexity of the
graphical model will make (approximate) inference and
learning more difficult, and this provides an intriguing
application for efficient techniques that have recently been
proposed (e.g., [38], [40], and [57]–[61]). Also, since the
size of the graphical model will often vary from one photo
(or event) to the next, one must explore whether it is
possible to learn a single set of parameters for variable sized graphs or whether a separate set of parameters must
be learned for each graph topology.
Ultimately, the growth of online social networks, the
development of improved social tagging systems, and the
increasing interconnectivity of the web have the potential
to enhance our ability to achieve face recognition at scale.
Exploring computational techniques that take advantage of
these trends seems a worthwhile endeavor. ",Person recognition,"This paper discusses the potential of leveraging social network context for scalable face recognition systems.

personality, but their performance has been relatively poor or they have lacked the ability to interpret
personality. In this paper, we present a novel interpretable personality recognition model based on
a personality lexicon. First, we use word embedding techniques and prior-knowledge lexicons to
automatically construct a Chinese semantic lexicon suitable for personality analysis. Based on this
personality lexicon, we analyze the correlations between personality traits and semantic categories
of words, and extract the semantic features of users’ microblogs to construct personality recognition
models using classification algorithms. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the
proposed model can achieve significantly better performances compared to previous approaches.","In this paper, we present an automatic approach to construct-
ing a personality lexicon suitable for personality recognition.
From users’ microblogs, we first extract representative words
using text-mining methods. We then use a clustering algorithm
to separate the representative words into various groups, each
of which is defined as a semantic category. The identified se-
mantic categories form a semantic lexicon as the first Chinese
personality lexicon. During the lexicon’s construction, a main
challenge pertains to how to accurately represent the words. We
use word embedding in a large corpus to obtain original word
vectors, and then use popular Chinese lexicons to refine word
vectors. Based on the personality lexicon, we analyze the correla-
tions between personality traits and word categories, and thereby
enable exploration and interpretation of personality traits using

semantic features of words, which are used to train personality

trait-specific errors as close as possible. To further enhance the reliability of our model, we employ (pre-trained)
state-of-the-art architectures (i.e., ResNet, VGGish, ELMo) as the backbones of the modality-specific subnetworks, which are complemented by multilayered Long Short-Term Memory networks to capture temporal dynamics. To minimize the computational complexity of multimodal optimization, we use two-stage modeling,
where the modality-specific subnetworks are first trained individually, and the whole network is then finetuned to jointly model multimodal data. On the large scale ChaLearn First Impressions V2 challenge dataset,
we evaluate the reliability of our model as well as investigating the informativeness of the considered modalities.
Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed attention mechanism and the error consistency constraint. While the best performance is obtained using facial information among individual modalities, with the
use of all four modalities, our model achieves a mean accuracy of 91.8%, improving the state of the art in automatic personality analysis.","We propose a novel multimodal approach for the estimation of apparent personality traits. Our method relies on four subnetworks, each
of which focuses on a specific modality, namely ambient appearance, facial appearance, voice, and transcribed speech. These subnetworks employ state-of-the-art deep architectures (e.g., ResNet-v2-101, VGGish,
ELMo) as backbones, and they are complemented with additional
LSTM layers to leverage temporal information. For more effective
modeling, first, each of the aforementioned subnetworks has been initialized with the (pre-trained) weight parameters of the corresponding
backbone network and trained (fine-tuned) in a modality-specific manner. Then, these subnetworks (after removing their regression layers)
have been combined and complemented by feature attention and regression layers. While the parameters of the subnetworks are kept frozen, new layers of the whole network have been trained to minimize
the average MAE of predicting the five personality traits as well as keeping the errors for each modality as close as possible to each other using
the proposed error consistency constraint. In this way, our model prevents overfitting to some specific traits due to joint multi-task optimization. Although the proposed architecture is end-to-end trainable, we
have followed a hierarchical training to minimize computational costs
while improving effectiveness.
Our framework has been thoroughly evaluated on the large-scale
ChaLearn First Impressions dataset. The effectiveness and reliability of
the proposed feature attention mechanism and the error consistency
constraint have been systematically assessed. Besides, the informativeness of different modalities and the added value of their joint use have
been investigated. Our results show that the proposed feature attention
and error consistency constraint are indeed useful and improve prediction accuracy. With the use of ambient appearance, facial appearance,

express opinions. As information propagates fast in social network, understanding and analyzing public
sentiment implied in user-generated content is beneficial for many fields and has been applied to applications such as social management, business and public security. Most previous work on sentiment
analysis makes no distinctions of the tweets by different users and ignores the diverse word use of people. As some sentiment expressions are used by specific groups of people, the corresponding textual
sentiment features are often neglected in the analysis process. On the other hand, previous psychological
findings have shown that personality influences the ways people write and talk, suggesting that people
with same personality traits tend to choose similar sentiment expressions. Inspired by this, in this paper we propose a method to facilitate sentiment classification in microblog based on personality traits. To
this end, we first develop a rule-based method to predict users’ personality traits based on the most wellstudied personality model, the Big Five model. In order to leverage more effective but not widely used
sentiment features, we then extract those features grouped by different personality traits and construct
personality-based sentiment classifiers. Moreover, we adopt an ensemble learning strategy to integrate
traditional textual feature based and our personality-based sentiment classification. Experimental studies

Social network sites have recently been used to carry out harmful attacks against individuals, including political and theological figures, intellectuals, sports and movie stars, and other prominent dignitaries, which may or may not be intentional. However, the exchange of such information across the general population inevitably contributes to social-economic, socio-political turmoil, and even physical violence in society. By classifying the derogatory content of a social media post, this research work helps to eradicate and discourage the upsetting propagation of such hate campaigns. Social networking posts today often include the picture of Memes along with textual remarks and comments, which throw new challenges and opportunities to the research community while identifying the attacks. This article proposes a multimodal deep learning framework by utilizing ensembles of computer vision and natural language processing techniques to train an encapsulated transformer network for handling the classification problem. The proposed framework utilizes the fine-tuned state-of-the-art deep learning-based models (e.g., BERT, Electra) for multilingual text analysis along with face recognition and the optical character recognition model for Meme picture comprehension. For the study, a new Facebook meme-post dataset is created with recorded baseline results.

face recognition is attracting much attention in the society of network multimedia information access. Areas such as network security, 
content indexing and retrieval, and video compression benefits from face recognition technology because ""people"" are the center of attention 
in a lot of video. Network access control via face recognition not only makes hackers virtually impossible to steal one's ""password"", but also 
increases the User friendliness in human-computer interaction. Indexing and/or retrieving video data based on the appearances of particular 
persons will be useful for users such as news reporters, political scientists, and moviegoers [2]. In this paper we focus on 3-D facial 
recognition system and biometric facial recognition system.","Face recognition technologies have been associated generally 
with very costly top secure applications. Today the core 
technologies have evolved and the cost of equipment is going 
down dramatically due to the integration and the increasing

Face to face communication is a real-time process operating at a a time scale in the order of 40 milliseconds. The level of uncertainty at this time scale is considerable, making it necessary for humans and machines to rely on sensory rich perceptual primitives rather than slow symbolic inference processes. In this paper we present progress on one such perceptual primitive. The system automatically detects frontal faces in the video stream and codes them with respect to 7 dimensions in real time: neutral, anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. The face finder employs a cascade of feature detectors trained with boosting techniques [15, 2]. The expression recognizer receives image patches located by the face detector. A Gabor representation of the patch is formed and then processed by a bank of SVM classifiers. A novel combination of Adaboost and SVM's enhances performance. The system was tested on the Cohn-Kanade dataset of posed facial expressions [6]. The generalization performance to new subjects for a 7- way forced choice correct. Most interestingly the outputs of the classifier change smoothly as a function of time, providing a potentially valuable representation to code facial expression dynamics in a fully automatic and unobtrusive manner.

It is based on guidance from psychological studies of emotion, as well as from the nature of emotion in its interaction with attention. A neural network architecture is constructed to be able to handle the fusion of different modalities (facial features, prosody and lexical content in speech). Results from the network are given and their implications discussed, as are implications for future direction for the research","In this paper we have introduced the framework of the EC project ERMIS. The aim of this project was to build an automatic emotion recognition system able to exploit multimodal emotional markers such as those embedded in the voice, face and words spoken. We discussed the numerous potential applications of such a system for industry as well as in academia. We then turned to the psychological literature to help lay the theoretical foundation of our system and make use of insights from the various emotion theories proposed in shaping the various components of our automatic emotion recognition system such as the input and output representations as well as the internal structure. We thus looked at the different proposals with respect to the size (basic emotions hypothesis) and nature (discrete or continuous) of the emotional space as well as its origin (evolution or social learning) and hierarchical structure (primary, secondary).

We then proceeded to discuss several issues that pertain to emotion recognition as suggested by psychological research. These were explored separately for the input and the output of the automatic recognition system. The input-related issues involved inconsistencies in the expression of emotion due to social norm, deceptive purposes as well as natural ambiguity of emotional expression. The output-related issues pertained to the nature of the representation of emotional states (discrete and categorical or continuous and non-categorical) as well as the time course of emotional states and the implications of different time scales for automatic recognition. We then proceeded to examine the features that can be used as emotional markers in the various modalities as well as the computational studies carried out based on those features. We also looked at the neural correlates of the perception of those features or markers. With respect to the word stream we reviewed the state-of-the-art in emotion extraction from text and presented our DAL system developed for ERMIS.

We then presented an artificial neural network called ANNA developed for the automatic classification of emotional states driven by a multimodal feature input. The novel feature of ANNA is the feedback attentional loop designed to exploit the attention-grabbing effect of emotional stimuli to further enhance and clarify the salient components of the input stream. Finally we presented the results obtained through the use of ANNA on training and testing material based on the SALAS scenario developed within the ERMIS framework.

The results obtained by using ANNA indicate that there can be crucial differences between subjects as to the clues they pick up from others about the emotional states of the latter. This was shown in the Table 1 of results, and discussed in 5.3 Analysis of results in, 5.4 Conclusions on the results. It is that feature, as well as to possible differences across what different human objects also ‘release’ to others about their inner emotional states, whose implications for constructing an artificial emotion state detector we need to consider carefully.

204,,Emotion recognition from geometric facial features using self-organizing map,Facial expression analysisGeometric facial featuresSelf-organizing mapFeatures extractionSystem identificationRadial basis functionMulti-layer perceptronSupport vector machine,"This paper presents a novel emotion recognition model using the system identification approach. A comprehensive data driven model using an extended Kohonen self-organizing map (KSOM) has been developed whose input is a 26 dimensional facial geometric feature vector comprising eye, lip and eyebrow feature points. The analytical face model using this 26 dimensional geometric feature vector has been effectively used to describe the facial changes due to different expressions. This paper thus includes an automated generation scheme of this geometric facial feature vector. The proposed non-heuristic model has been developed using training data from MMI facial expression database. The emotion recognition accuracy of the proposed scheme has been compared with radial basis function network, multi-layered perceptron model and support vector machine based recognition schemes. The experimental results show that the proposed model is very efficient in recognizing six basic emotions while ensuring significant increase in average classification accuracy over radial basis function and multi-layered perceptron. It also shows that the average recognition rate of the proposed method is comparatively better than multi-class support vector machine.","A completely automated system for facial geometric features detection and facial expression classification is proposed. We introduce different techniques to detect eyebrow features, nose features, state of eyes and lip features. The proposed eye state detection method gives a clear distinction between different states of eye opening. The detection results for eyebrow feature points and lip feature points are compared against the ground truth. It is observed that for a neutral face having lips with height and width 33 and 65 pixels respectively, the average detection error is only 2.81 pixels. And for eyebrows with height and width 15 and 55 respectively, the average error is 1.45 pixels, which can be considered as very less.

A new mechanism is introduced based on 2D KSOM network to recognize facial expression that uses only a 26 dimensional geometric feature vector, containing directional displacement information about each feature point. The KSOM network parameters are updated simultaneously to train the model for six basic emotions as a function of 26 directional displacement data. Experimentation is carried out over 81 video clips taken from MMI database. An average recognition rate of 93.53% is achieved using the proposed KSOM based recognition method, with the highest recognition rate as 98.33%. The performance of the proposed method is compared with three widely used classifiers: RBFN, MLP3 and multi-class SVM. The average recognition accuracy using RBFN is found as 66.54%, which is much lower than the recognition rate found using our proposed method. MLP3 gives comparatively better performance than RBFN with average recognition rate 72.15%. However, MLP3 achieved highest recognition rate for happiness data (97.3%) among all the four classification methods. On the other hand, the KSOM based recognition method gives much better performance on average than RBFN and MLP3. The performance of KSOM is increased by 1% as compared to the multi-class SVM which is known to be the state of the art in classification. The relative increase of recognition accuracy using KSOM over MLP3 is 21.39% and over RBFN is 26.99% which is a significant improvement. Thus, the extensive experiment illustrates the effectiveness and accuracy of KSOM based facial expression recognition system using only geometric features.",Deep Learning and Machine Learning,"The paper proposes a novel emotion recognition model using the system identification approach, which utilizes an extended Kohonen self-organizing map (KSOM) and a 26 dimensional facial geometric feature vector.

205,,An event-related potential comparison of facial expression processing between cartoon and real faces,,"Faces play important roles in the social lives of humans. Besides real faces, people also encounter numerous cartoon faces in daily life which convey basic emotional states through facial expressions. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we conducted a facial expression recognition experiment with 17 university students to compare the processing of cartoon faces with that of real faces. This study used face type (real vs. cartoon), emotion valence (happy vs. angry) and participant gender (male vs. female) as independent variables. Reaction time, recognition accuracy, and the amplitudes and latencies of emotion processing-related ERP components such as N170, VPP (vertex positive potential), and LPP (late positive potential) were used as dependent variables. The ERP results revealed that cartoon faces caused larger N170 and VPP amplitudes as well as a briefer N170 latency than did real faces; that real faces induced larger LPP amplitudes than did cartoon faces. In addition, the results showed a significant difference in the brain regions as reflected in a right hemispheric advantage. The behavioral results showed that the reaction times for happy faces were shorter than those for angry faces; that females showed a higher accuracy than did males; and that males showed a higher recognition accuracy for angry faces than happy faces. Due to the sample size, these results may suggestively but not rigorously demonstrate differences in facial expression recognition and neurological processing between cartoon faces and real faces. Cartoon faces showed a higher processing intensity and speed than real faces during the early processing stage. However, more attentional resources were allocated for real faces during the late processing stage.","We used ERPs to measure the brain activity responses induced by the facial expressions of cartoon and real faces.

Follow-up","Although the adverse consequences of changes in social behavior following traumatic brain injury (TBI) are well documented, relatively little is known about possible underlying neuropsychological deficits. Following a model originally developed for social behavior deficits in schizophrenia, we investigated whether impairments in emotion recognition, understanding of other people's intentions (“theory of mind”), and cognitive flexibility soon after first TBI or 1 year later were associated with self and proxy ratings of behavior following TBI. Each of the three functions was assessed with two separate tests, and ratings of behavior were collected on three questionnaires. Patients with TBI (n = 33) were impaired in emotion recognition, “theory of mind,” and cognitive flexibility compared with matched orthopedic controls (n = 34). Proxy ratings showed increases in behavioral problems 1 year following injury in the TBI group but not in the control group. However, test performance was not associated with questionnaire data. Severity of the impairments in emotion recognition, understanding intention, and flexibility were unrelated to the severity of behavioral problems following TBI. These findings failed to confirm the used model for social behavior deficits and may cast doubt on the alleged link between deficits in emotion recognition or theory of mind and social functioning. ","The aim of this study was to investigate whether deficits in emotion recognition, understanding intentions (ToM), or cognitive flexibility might underlie changes in social behavior following TBI.

207,,Review: Posed vs. Genuine Facial Emotion Recognition and Expression in Autism and Implications for Intervention,,"Different styles of social interaction are one of the core characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Social differences among individuals with ASD often include difficulty in discerning the emotions of neurotypical people based on their facial expressions. This review first covers the rich body of literature studying differences in facial emotion recognition (FER) in those with ASD, including behavioral studies and neurological findings. In particular, we highlight subtle emotion recognition and various factors related to inconsistent findings in behavioral studies of FER in ASD. Then, we discuss the dual problem of FER – namely facial emotion expression (FEE) or the production of facial expressions of emotion. Despite being less studied, social interaction involves both the ability to recognize emotions and to produce appropriate facial expressions. How others perceive facial expressions of emotion in those with ASD has remained an under-researched area. Finally, we propose a method for teaching FER [FER teaching hierarchy (FERTH)] based on recent research investigating FER in ASD, considering the use of posed vs. genuine emotions and static vs. dynamic stimuli. We also propose two possible teaching approaches: (1) a standard method of teaching progressively from simple drawings and cartoon characters to more complex audio-visual video clips of genuine human expressions of emotion with context clues or (2) teaching in a field of images that includes posed and genuine emotions to improve generalizability before progressing to more complex audio-visual stimuli. Lastly, we advocate for autism interventionists to use FER stimuli developed primarily for research purposes to facilitate the incorporation of well-controlled stimuli to teach FER and bridge the gap between intervention and research in this area.","In conclusion, this article reviews the research on facial emotion recognition (FER) and facial emotion expression (FEE) in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

No evidence was found for negative interpretation biases in children with HFA or SP (i.e., all groups showed similar ability to discriminate neutral from non-neutral facial expressions). However, distinct between-group differences emerged when considering facial expression intensity. Specifically, children with HFA detected mild affective expressions less accurately than TD peers.

Overall, patients identified facial emotions significantly worse than healthy controls (p = 0.018) with a significant main effect for type of emotion (p = 0.016). Patients performed significantly worse in fear (p = 0.029) and sadness (p = 0.037), and marginally worse in anger (p = 0.052). No significant differences were evident in contempt (p = 0.254) or happiness (p = 0.943). Regarding error rates of misattribution, patients overidentified contempt (p = 0.035) and sadness (p = 0.01), but not anger, fear, or happiness.

However, due to the coarse-grained classification of cartoon materials, cartoon animators can hardly find relevant materials during the process of creation. The polar emotions of cartoon materials are an important reference for creators as they can help them easily obtain the pictures they need. Some methods for obtaining the emotions of cartoon pictures have been proposed, but most of these focus on expression recognition. Meanwhile, other emotion recognition methods are not ideal for use as cartoon materials. We propose a deep learning-based method to classify the polar emotions of the cartoon pictures of the ""Moe"" drawing style. According to the expression feature of the cartoon characters of this drawing style, we recognize the facial expressions of cartoon characters and extract the scene and facial features of the cartoon images. Then, we correct the emotions of the pictures obtained by the expression recognition according to the scene features. Finally, we can obtain the polar emotions of corresponding picture. We designed a dataset and performed verification tests on it, achieving 81.9% experimental accuracy. The experimental results prove that our method is competitive.","In conclusion, the cartoon animation industry has become a vast industrial chain, but cartoon animators often struggle to find relevant materials during the creative process due to the coarse-grained classification of cartoon materials.

To understand the specificity of purported ER differences, the goal of this study was to examine ER from music compared with faces and voices among children on the AS and TD children. Twenty-five children on the AS and 23 TD children (6–13 years) completed an ER task, using categorical (happy, sad, fear) and dimensional (valence, arousal) ratings, of emotions presented via music, faces, or voices. Compared to the TD group, the AS group showed a relative ER strength from music, and comparable performance from faces and voices. Although both groups demonstrated greater vocal ER accuracy, the children on the AS performed equally well with music and faces, whereas the TD children performed better with faces than with music. Both groups performed comparably with dimensional ratings, except for greater variability by the children on the AS in valence ratings for happy emotions. These findings highlight a need to re-examine ER of children on the AS, and to consider how facilitating strengths-based approaches can re-shape our thinking about and support for persons on the AS.","The findings from this study of ER across multiple basic emotions, stimulus types, and response options, help to dispel notions of deficits of the ability to explicitly recognize and label basic emotions of children on the AS relative to TD children. Instead, findings of comparable ER accuracy (in faces and voices) or relative strengths (in musical ER) depending on the stimulus type provides support for the use of music therapy, education, and interventions. Ultimately, our findings contribute to efforts to provide a nuanced understanding of the ways in which we can re-shape our thinking about persons on the AS by engaging their preferences and strengths.

Some studies ask participants to classify the emotions expressed by the stimuli as positive or negative, and others ask participants to rate the intensity of the emotions expressed by the stimuli. Such variability in tasks may account for the differential outcomes in patients' recognition of positive and negative emotions.

matrix joint diagonalization algorithm SGR to deal with it. Simulations demonstrated that SGR converges fast and the contrast function gets excellent level when it converges, and also SGR shows
a strong anti-perturbation performance of the diagonalized matrices. The proposed BSS algorithm can be used to separate temporal
correlated noncircular Gaussian and non-Gaussian sources. For illuminating its performance, we design four experiments to compare
it with other various algorithms, which are based on either ICA
or matrix joint diagonalization of several time-delayed (pseudo)
covariance matrices of mixed signals. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed BSS algorithm. At

commencing construction is widely employed to prevent accidents, it typically fails because of insufficient safety experience. The experience helps in training novice inspectors, although extracting and
describing tacit knowledge explicitly is difficult. This study created a digital building construction site,
and designed a hazard-identification experiment involving four workplaces featuring obvious and unobvious hazards (e.g., falls, collapses, and electric shocks), and an eye-tracker was used to compare the
search patterns of the experienced and novice workers. The results indicated that experience assisted
the experienced workers in assessing both obvious (p < 0.001) and unobvious hazards (p = 0.004) significantly faster than the novice workers could; however, it did not improve the accuracy with which they
identified hazards, indicating that general work experience is not equivalent to safety-specific experience, and may not necessarily improve workers’ accuracy in identifying hazards. Nevertheless, the experienced workers were more confident in identifying hazards, they exhibited fewer fixations, and their
scan paths for assessing hazards were more consistent. The experienced workers first assessed the
high-risk targets—laborers working at heights—and subsequently assessed those working on the ground,
followed by the equipment or environment. Furthermore, they typically inspected openings later than
novice workers did. The search strategies identified may be incorporated into the training courses to
improve the hazard awareness for novice workers.","The construction industry has high accident rates and fatalities, and hazard identification is a widely used approach for preventing accidents.

management, and services aimed at health maintenance. This study used Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data 
from primary care clinics in seven provinces across Canada to develop predictive models to identify COPD in the 
Canadian population. The comprehensive nature of this primary care EMR data containing structured numeric,

Utilizing feature importance, we identified a set of key symptoms from the EMR for diagnosing COPD, which 
included medications, health conditions, risk factors, and patient age. Application of this XGB model to primary 
care structured EMR data can identify patients with COPD from others having similar chronic conditions for 
disease surveillance, and improve evidence-based care delivery.","We developed machine learning models to identify COPD patients

computation paradigm as a search method for classifiers, helping the applied machine learning
technique. In this context, the knowledge representation in the form of logical rules has been one
of the most accepted machine learning approaches, because of its level of expressiveness. This paper
proposes an evolutionary framework for rule-based classifier induction. Our proposal introduces
genetic programming to build a search method for classification-rules (IF/THEN). From this approach,
we deal with problems such as, maximum rule length and rule intersection. The experiments have
been carried out on our domain of interest, medical data. The achieved results define a methodology
to follow in the learning method evaluation for knowledge discovery from medical data. Moreover, the
results compared to other methods have shown that our proposal can be very useful in data analysis
and classification coming from the medical domain.","Machine learning, as a practical matter, deals with the extraction of the right features from the data to build the right models
achieving the right tasks [6,60]. We have also seen that the most
common approaches used in machine learning are classification
and regression. In that sense, we can say that machine learning processes aim to render classification expressions as simple
as possible for humans to understand [67]. The creation and
assessment of intelligent machines whose learning is based on
experience as well as being able to generalize learned concepts
are the main challenges faced by machine learning. Such challenges have resulted in the problem of choosing the machine
learning method that best fits the data (or the problem at hand)
since there is not a winner method in all aspects.
In this context, this research has introduced: the main concepts treated in machine learning, some of the learning models
aimed to classification and the data domain of our interest, clinical data. So that, we have given the aim pursued by this research
in the analysis of clinical data. In this sense, we have described a
framework based on an evolutionary algorithm capable of inducing a rule set to correctly classify a set of patterns. The algorithm
implements a sequential covering technique and has been validated through well-known data sets. We have also provided
a formal analysis for the problem of assessing the quality of
the solutions in the presence of class intersection. The results
achieved are very promising and competitive when compared

identification of fitness functions allowing our evolutionary

identified the combination of fitness functions providing classifiers with the smallest number of rules. Thirdly, an ensemble
classifier model has been proposed and tested to face the rule
intersection problem. Finally and from the theoretical point of
view, we have computed an upper bound for the maximum rule
size in relation to the training data set. This contribution has
practical implications such as, improvement of the runtime and
memory used by the learning method. Therefore, all previous
contributions prove that the evolutionary framework for rule induction, introduced in this work can be very useful in the analysis

increased morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery. Most established prediction models are limited to the
analysis of nonlinear relationships and fail to fully consider intraoperative variables, which represent the acute
response to surgery. Therefore, this study utilized an artificial intelligence–based machine learning approach
thorough perioperative data-driven learning to predict CSA-AKI.
A total of 671 patients undergoing cardiac surgery from August 2016 to August 2018 were enrolled. AKI
following cardiac surgery was defined according to criteria from Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO).
The variables used for analysis included demographic characteristics, clinical condition, preoperative biochemistry data,
preoperative medication, and intraoperative variables such as time-series hemodynamic changes. The machine
learning methods used included logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), extreme
gradient boosting (XGboost), and ensemble (RF + XGboost). The performance of these models was evaluated using
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We also utilized SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP)
values to explain the prediction model.
Development of CSA-AKI was noted in 163 patients (24.3%) during the first postoperative week. Regarding the
efficacy of the single model that most accurately predicted the outcome, RF exhibited the greatest AUC (0.839, 95%

Prostate cancer screening
Attention.","Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) tools help radiologists to reduce diagnostic errors such as missing tumors and misdiagnosis. Vision researchers have been analyzing behaviors of radiologists during screening
to understand how and why they miss tumors or misdiagnose. In this regard, eye-trackers have been instrumental in understanding visual search processes of radiologists. However, most relevant studies in
this aspect are not compatible with realistic radiology reading rooms. In this study, we aim to develop
a paradigm shifting CAD system, called collaborative CAD (C-CAD), that unifies CAD and eye-tracking
systems in realistic radiology room settings. We first developed an eye-tracking interface providing radiologists with a real radiology reading room experience. Second, we propose a novel algorithm that unifies
eye-tracking data and a CAD system. Specifically, we present a new graph based clustering and sparsification algorithm to transform eye-tracking data (gaze) into a graph model to interpret gaze patterns quantitatively and qualitatively. The proposed C-CAD collaborates with radiologists via eye-tracking technology and helps them to improve their diagnostic decisions. The C-CAD uses radiologists’ search efficiency
by processing their gaze patterns. Furthermore, the C-CAD incorporates a deep learning algorithm in a
newly designed multi-task learning platform to segment and diagnose suspicious areas simultaneously.
The proposed C-CAD system has been tested in a lung cancer screening experiment with multiple radiologists, reading low dose chest CTs. Promising results support the efficiency, accuracy and applicability
of the proposed C-CAD system in a real radiology room setting. We have also shown that our framework
is generalizable to more complex applications such as prostate cancer screening with multi-parametric
magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI).","Our study offers a new perspective on eye-tracking studies in
radiology because of its seamless integration into the real radiology
rooms and collaborative nature of image analysis methods. First,
the proposed system models the raw gaze data from eye-tracker as
a graph. Then, a novel attention based spectral graph sparsification
method is proposed to extract global search pattern of radiologist
as well as attention regions. Later, we propose a 3D deep multitask learning based CNN to perform diagnosis and segmentation
tasks jointly inside ROIs. Our proposed sparsification method reduced 90% of data within seconds while keeping mean the square
error under 0.1. The segmentation algorithm achieved the average
Dice Similarity Coefficient of 91% and classification accuracy for
nodule vs. non-nodule was 97%.
As can be interpreted from the lung screening experiment,
the less experienced participant had more crowded visual search
patterns and examined the most lung volume.
Our work has some limitations that should be noted. One of the
limitations is the lack of large amount of data for training more
sophisticated deep learning models as well as conducting scanpath
analysis with several other radiologists. In our extended study, we
plan to address this limitation and explore the validity of the proposed methods in different settings, incorporating the behavioral
patterns into screening experiments such as cognitive fatigue of
the radiologists.
For lung cancer screening with C-CAD, our system has the assumption that the radiologists are examining only lung regions and
the ROIs fall into the lung regions. If the radiologist starts focusing
on some other areas, outside the lungs, the segmentation results
might not be as desired, because of non-lung regions. To solve this
problem, one may include a simple segmentation step into the CCAD to restricts the ROI definition into the lungs only. However,
this procedure may affect analysis of incidental findings too.
In conclusion, CAD systems are often prone to high number
of false positives findings, which is one of the main drawbacks
in such systems. Missing tumors, especially in their early stages,
is also very common in screening. To increase the efficacy of the
lung cancer screening process, we propose a novel computer algorithm, namely collaborative CAD (C-CAD). Our proposed method
takes into account the gaze data of radiologists during the screening process, and incorporates this information into the CAD system
for better accuracy in reducing false positive findings in particular. In return, C-CAD has the capability of improving true positive
findings as well as reducing missing cases. With our proposed attention based graph sparsification method, qualitative comparison
and analysis of different radiologists’ visual search patterns (both
locally and globally) has become feasible. It is worth noting that
we are doing a local image analysis in the regions of interest and
not solving the detection problem per se. It is also worth noting
that, although deep learning has improved the accuracy and performance of detection methods, the efficiency of search is still a
big issue in state of the art detection methods (Khosravan and
Bagci, 2018a). Our proposed system is a promising step toward
combining the efficiency of searching strategy from the expert radiologist and accuracy of analysis from deep learning methods.
Since our framework is capable of integrating any image analysis
block as well as a detection block, having a detection task on top of
diagnosis and segmentation is a promising future direction which
enables the framework to handle cases that are missed by radiologists.",Medical Data Analysis,"The text describes a new computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system called Collaborative CAD (C-CAD) that uses eye-tracking technology and a deep learning algorithm to assist radiologists in reducing diagnostic errors in lung and prostate cancer screening.

Deep learning.","Recently, many researchers have conducted data mining over medical data to uncover hidden
patterns and use them to learn prediction models for clinical decision making and personalized
medicine. While such healthcare learning models can achieve encouraging results, they seldom
incorporate existing expert knowledge into their frameworks and hence prediction accuracy for
individual patients can still be improved. However, expert knowledge spans across various websites and multiple databases with heterogeneous representations and hence is difficult to harness
for improving learning models. In addition, patients' queries at medical consult websites are often
ambiguous in their specified terms and hence the returned responses may not contain the information they seek. To tackle these problems, we first design a knowledge extraction framework that
can generate an aggregated dataset to characterize diseases by integrating heterogeneous medical
data sources. Then, based on the integrated dataset, we propose an end-to-end deep learning based
medical diagnosis system (DL-MDS) to provide disease diagnosis for authorized users. We also
provide explanations for the diagnose results. Evaluations on real-world data demonstrate that our
proposed system achieves good performance on diseases diagnosis with a diverse set of patients’
queries.","In this paper, we have proposed a deep learning based medical diagnosis system (DL-MDS), which can be used to aid efficient clinical
care, where authorized users can conduct searches for medical diagnosis. One of our major contributions is that we have designed a
medical knowledge extraction framework to collect useful data from multiple sources, so that we can further generate medical diagnosis
models. The other is that we have generated a deep learning based model, which allows authorized users to conduct searches for medical
diagnosis based on their personalized queries and also provides explanations for the predicted results.
As for future work, instead of training separate query processing model and disease diagnosis model, we will integrate them and train
an end-to-end model. In addition, although the results indicate that a machine learning-based predictive model generated using
aggregated collected data could aid in clinical care, improvement can be made if we can include additional information such as lab tests
results since some diseases (e.g., cancer) cannot be diagnosed accurately only based on symptoms and risk factors. Furthermore, we also
intend to improve our DL-MDS to support multiple languages. For example, conduct NLP sentence processing and train the learning
models for Chinese users.",Medical Data Analysis,"The article discusses the limitations of existing healthcare learning models and the difficulty in incorporating expert knowledge from heterogeneous medical data sources.

In addition, we explored different types of data and tools that can be used in sentiment analysis research and suggested their strength and limitations. Finally, we emphasized the prospects for future development, suggestions for possible extensions, and specially presented an overview of multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA).

We approach the problem by developing a set of statistical models for a predefined lexicon. Novel concepts are then mapped in terms of the concepts in the lexicon. To achieve robust detection of concepts, we exploit features from multiple modalities, namely, audio, video, and text. Concept representations are modeled using Gaussian mixture models (GMM), hidden Markov models (HMM), and support vector machines (SVM). Models such as Bayesian networks and SVMs are used in a latefusion approach to model concepts that are not explicitly modeled in terms of features. Our experiments indicate promise in the proposed classification and fusion methodologies: our proposed fusion scheme achieves more than 10% relative improvement over the best unimodal concept detector.","The paper presented an overview of a trainable QBK system for labeling semantic-concepts within unrestricted video. Feasibility of the framework was demonstrated for the semantic-concept rocket launch, first for concept classification using information in single modalities and then for concept classification using information from multiple modalities. These experimental results, whilst preliminary, suffice to show that information from multiple modalities (visual, audio, speech, and potentially video text) can be successfully integrated to improve semantic labeling performance over that achieved by any single modality. There is considerable potential for improving the schemes described for atomic and high-level concept classification. Future research directions include the utility of multimodal fusion in atomic concept models (using, e.g., coupled HMMs or other dynamic Bayesian networks), and the appropriateness of shot-level rather than scene-level (or other) labeling schemes. Schemes must also be identified for automatically determining the low-level features (from a predefined set of possibilities) which are most appropriate for labeling atomic concepts and for determining atomic concepts (amongst the predefined set of possibilities) which are related to higher-level semantic-concepts.

Aspect based sentiment analysis is performed in two steps, viz. aspect term extraction and sentiment classification. The pruned, compact set of features performs better compared to the baseline model that makes use of the complete set of features for aspect term extraction and sentiment classification. We further construct an ensemble based on PSO, and put it in cascade after the feature selection module. We use the features that are identified based on the properties of different classifiers and domains. As base learning algorithms we use three classifiers, namely Maximum Entropy (ME), Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Experiments for aspect term extraction and sentiment analysis on two different kinds of domains show the effectiveness of our proposed approach.","In this paper we have presented an efficient method for feature selection and ensemble learning for aspect based sentiment analysis. The algorithm is based on single objective PSO. As base learning algorithms we use CRF, SVM and ME. In the first step we determine the best feature sets for aspect term extraction and sentiment classification. This yields a set of solutions, each of which represents a particular feature combination. Based on certain criteria we choose the most promising solutions from the final population of PSO. The models developed with these feature combinations are combined together using a PSO based ensemble technique. The ensemble learner finds out the most eligible models, that when combined together, maximizes some classification quality measures like F-measure (for aspect term extraction) or accuracy (for sentiment classification). As the base learning algorithms we use three classifiers, namely ME, CRF and SVM. We have identified and implemented various lexical, syntactic or semantic level features for solving the problems. Experiments on the benchmark datasets of SemEval-2014 show our proposed techniques attain state-of-the-art performance for both aspect term extraction and sentiment classification. We compare the performance with the best performing systems that were developed using the same setups, several baseline models and the existing systems. In all the settings our proposed methods showed the effectiveness with reasonable performance increments. The key contributions of the current work can be summarized as below: (i). proposal of a two-step process for feature selection and ensemble learning using PSO; (ii). developing a PSO based feature selection and ensemble learning technique for the application like sentiment analysis; (iii). building domain-independent models for aspect based sentiment analysis that achieves state-of-the-art performance; (iv). finding how efficiently we can improve the classifiers’ performance if it is trained with the most relevant set of features (particularly for sentiment analysis). The current work focuses on single objective optimization technique, where we deal with only one objective function at a time.

237,,A hybrid approach to the sentiment analysis problem at the sentence level,Sentiment analysis Semantic rules Fuzzy sets Unsupervised machine learning SentiWordNet Naïve Bayes Maximum entropy Computing with sentiments,"The objective of this article is to present a hybrid approach to the Sentiment Analysis problem at the sentence level. This new method uses natural language processing (NLP) essential techniques, a sentiment lexicon enhanced with the assistance of SentiWordNet, and fuzzy sets to estimate the semantic orientation polarity and its intensity for sentences, which provides a foundation for computing with sentiments. The proposed hybrid method is applied to three different data-sets and the results achieved are compared to those obtained using Naïve Bayes and Maximum Entropy techniques. It is demonstrated that the presented hybrid approach is more accurate and precise than both Naïve Bayes and Maximum Entropy techniques, when the latter are utilised in isolation. In addition, it is shown that when applied to datasets containing snippets, the proposed method performs similarly to state of the art techniques","In general, our proposed hybrid system works very well at the sentence level with a high level of accuracy (88.02%) and precision (84.24%) when the method is applied against twitter-like datasets. The fact that our hybrid system significantly improved the results obtained using Naïve Bayes (NB) and Maximum Entropy (ME), satisfies our initial hypothesis that a hybrid method using sentiment lexicons, NLP essential techniques and fuzzy sets, should be able to perform well. Another benefit of our proposed system is that we have managed to identify different strengths in the polarity degree of the input sentences with regard to the specific base-case (negative or positive). There is an interesting and intended effect of the introduction of the fuzzy sets component of our method. Those sentences classified in the ‘poor’ side of the polarity intensity spectrum are prime candidates to be considered rather neutral or objective sentences, instead of subjective (this functionality could be built into a subjectivity determination schema). Our expectation is that the quality of the content of SentiWordNet, or more recent tools like SenticNet [9], should continue to improve with time. Those enhancements will contribute to the betterment of our proposed hybrid solution as it will reflect positively in the quality of our opinion lexicon. In theory, as time passes, both SentiWordNet and our proposed opinion lexicon should become better and more complete. The ability to incorporate new terms into the current opinion lexicon in an expedite way is another benefit provided by our proposed solution. In essence, hybrid techniques can play an important role in the advancement of the Sentiment Analysis discipline by combining together a number of elements that tend to produce better results. Similar results, in terms of combining techniques effectively, have been reported by other researches [52]. By carefully analysing the sentences processed using the aforementioned classification methods, we are capable of extracting the main characteristics in those sentences that posed a problem for our classification method. If we group together the cases that our system have considered challenging to classify properly, we find the following traits: • The use of jargon, argot, idiom and/or lingo is hard to deal with, and sometimes it misguides the system in classifying opinions properly. • Imagery, metaphors, similes, sarcasm, humour and other language figures that rely on previous knowledge and/or context represent a challenge for our system. For future research, a starting point would be the work of Justo et al. [32]. • Double negation offers difficulties that we must continue to study and improve. • In the presence of very complex paragraphs the precision of our proposed hybrid method is negatively impacted In terms of further work, we believe there are a number of avenues that should be pursued in the short-term: • Create an automatic real-time interface, via API, with SentiWordNet or functionally equivalent tool (see next item) to search dynamically for polarity and PoS tagging updates for all terms of interest. • Investigate the possibility of using SenticNet [9] as a source of a more mature and comprehensive set of semantic attributes to enrich our own lexicon -or replace it. The concept-level sentiment analysis approach introduced by Poria et al. [52], sentic patterns, and its dependency-based rules for concept-level sentiment analysis could provide a broader semantic coverage than the one we currently enjoy with SentiWordNet. • Work on an algorithm to incorporate context in the tagging/parsing process and in the sentiment-determination modules in order to improve the ability of the system to deal with humour, metaphors, similes, sarcasm and irony (an initial approach could be the utilisation of context-sensitive grammars during the parsing process). • Port the proof-of-concept prototype code from Scheme to C, C++, C# or Python, in order to increase efficiency and integration capabilities. • Continue developing a computing with sentiments approach, using as a foundation the method presented in this article. • Introduce the use of Induced OWA operators [71] as an aggregation mechanism in the calculation of the semantic orientation of sentences. This type of operator could be used to ensure that",sentiment analysis,"The article presents a hybrid approach to Sentiment Analysis using NLP techniques, a sentiment lexicon enhanced with SentiWordNet, and fuzzy sets to estimate polarity and intensity.

238,,Enhancing deep learning sentiment analysis with ensemble techniques in social applications,Ensemble Deep learning Sentiment analysis Machine learning Natural language processing,"Deep learning techniques for Sentiment Analysis have become very popular. They provide automatic feature extraction and both richer representation capabilities and better performance than traditional feature based techniques (i.e., surface methods). Traditional surface approaches are based on complex manually extracted features, and this extraction process is a fundamental question in feature driven methods. These long-established approaches can yield strong baselines, and their predictive capabilities can be used in conjunction with the arising deep learning methods. In this paper we seek to improve the performance of deep learning techniques integrating them with traditional surface approaches based on manually extracted features. The contributions of this paper are sixfold. First, we develop a deep learning based sentiment classifier using a word embeddings model and a linear machine learning algorithm. This classifier serves as a baseline to compare to subsequent results. Second, we propose two ensemble techniques which aggregate our baseline classifier with other surface classifiers widely used in Sentiment Analysis. Third, we also propose two models for combining both surface and deep features to merge information from several sources. Fourth, we introduce a taxonomy for classifying the different models found in the literature, as well as the ones we propose. Fifth, we conduct several experiments to compare the performance of these models with the deep learning baseline. For this, we use seven public datasets that were extracted from the microblogging and movie reviews domain. Finally, as a result, a statistical study confirms that the performance of these proposed models surpasses that of our original baseline on F1-Score","This paper proposes several models where classic hand-crafted features are combined with automatically extracted embedding features, as well as the ensemble of analyzers that learn from these varied features. In order to classify these different approaches, we propose a taxonomy of ensembles of classifiers and features that is based on two dimensions. Furthermore, with the aim of evaluating the proposed models, a deep learning baseline is defined, and the classification performances of several ensembles are compared to the performance of the baseline. With the intention of conducting a comparative experimental study, six public datasets are used for the evaluation of all the models, as well as six public sentiment classifiers. Finally, we conduct an statistical analysis in order to empirically verify that combining information from varied fea- O. Araque et al. / Expert Systems With Applications 77 (2017) 236–246 245 tures and/or analyzers is an adequate way to surpass the sentiment classification performance. There were three main research questions that drove this work. The first question was whether there is a framework to characterize existing approaches in relation to the ensemble of traditional and deep techniques in sentiment analysis. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal of a taxonomy and the resulting implementations is the first work to tackle this problem for sentiment analysis. The second question was whether the sentiment analysis performance of a deep classifier can be leveraged when using the proposed ensemble of classifiers and features models. Observing the scores table and the Friedman ranks (Table 5), we see that the proposed models generally improve the performance of the baseline. This indicates that the combination of information from diverse sources such as surface features, generic and affect word vectors effectively improves the classifier’s results in sentiment analysis tasks. Lastly, we raised the concern of which of the proposed models stand out in the improvement of the deep sentiment analysis performance. In this regard, the statistical results point out the CEMMeL SGA and MSG+bigrams models as the best performing alternatives. As expected, these models effectively combine different sources of sentiment information, resulting in a significant improvement with respect to the baseline. We remark the MSG+bigrams model, as it does not involve an ensemble of many classifiers, but only a classifier that is trained with an ensemble of deep and surface features. To summarize, this work takes advantage of the ensemble of existing traditional sentiment classifiers, as well as the combination of generic, sentiment-trained word embeddings and manually crafted features. Nevertheless, Considering the results of this work, we believe that a possible line of work would be applying these models to the task of aspect based sentiment analysis, with the hope of improving the classification performance. Furthermore, we intend to extend the domain of the proposed models to other languages and even paradigms, like Emotion analysis.",Deep Learning and Machine Learning,"The text discusses how deep learning techniques have become popular for sentiment analysis, providing better performance than traditional feature-based techniques.

239,,"Biographies, Bollywood, Boom-boxes and Blenders: Domain Adaptation for Sentiment Classification",sentiment classification,"Automatic sentiment classification has been extensively studied and applied in recent years. However, sentiment is expressed differently in different domains, and annotating corpora for every possible domain of interest is impractical. We investigate domain adaptation for sentiment classifiers, focusing on online reviews for different types of products. First, we extend to sentiment classification the recently-proposed structural correspondence learning (SCL) algorithm, reducing the relative error due to adaptation between domains by an average of 30% over the original SCL algorithm and 46% over a supervised baseline. Second, we identify a measure of domain similarity that correlates well with the potential for adaptation of a classifier from one domain to another. This measure could for instance be used to select a small set of domains to annotate whose trained classifiers would transfer well to many other domains.","Sentiment classification has seen a great deal of attention. Its application to many different domains of discourse makes it an ideal candidate for domain adaptation. This work addressed two important questions of domain adaptation. First, we showed that for a given source and target domain, we can significantly improve for sentiment classification the structural correspondence learning model of Blitzer et al. (2006). We chose pivot features using not only common frequency among domains but also mutual information with the source labels. We also showed how to correct structural correspondence misalignments by using a small amount of labeled target domain data. Second, we provided a method for selecting those source domains most likely to adapt well to given target domains. The unsupervised A-distance measure of divergence between domains correlates well with loss due to adaptation. Thus we can use the Adistance to select source domains to label which will give low target domain error. In the future, we wish to include some of the more recent advances in sentiment classification, as well as addressing the more realistic problem of ranking. We are also actively searching for a larger and more varied set of domains on which to test our techniques.",sentiment classification,"The text discusses the challenge of automatic sentiment classification in different domains and the impracticality of annotating corpora for every possible domain.

240,,Effectiveness of a short audiovisual emotion recognition training program in adults,,"The ability to recognize emotions from others’ nonverbal behavior (emotion recognition ability, ERA) is crucial to successful social functioning. However, currently no self-administered ERA training for non-clinical adults covering multiple sensory channels exists. We conducted four studies in a lifespan sample of participants in the laboratory and online (total N = 531) to examine the effectiveness of a short computer-based training for 14 different emotions using audiovisual clips of emotional expressions. Results showed that overall, young and middle-aged participants that had received the training scored significantly higher on facial, vocal, and audiovisual emotion recognition than the control groups. The training effect for audiovisual ERA persisted over 4 weeks. In older adults (59–90 years), however, the training had no effect. The new, brief training could be useful in applied settings such as professional training, at least for younger and middle-aged adults. In older adults, improving ERA might require a longer and more interactive intervention.","The present research is the first to validate a short, self-administered training program intended to improve emotion recognition ability (ERA) in the face, voice, and body across a wide range of positive and negative emotions. The training was found to increase ERA in younger and middle-aged adults when completed in the laboratory and online, and the effects persisted over at least four weeks. The training was similarly effective in both men and women and demonstrated transfer effects on different tests. However, the training did not improve ERA in older adults. The study also suggested that interventions focusing on many emotions and on multiple sensory modalities simultaneously might be more ecologically valid than more specialized interventions.

241,,Facial Emotion Recognition in Real Time,,"We have developed a convolutional neural network for
classifying human emotions from dynamic facial expressions in real time. We use transfer learning on the fullyconnected layers of an existing convolutional neural network which was pretrained for human emotion classification. A variety of datasets, as well as our own unique
image dataset, is used to train the model. An overall
training accuracy of 90.7% and test accuracy of 57.1%
is achieved. Finally, a live video stream connected to a
face detector feeds images to the neural network. The network subsequently classifies an arbitrary number of faces
per image simultaneously in real time, wherein appropriate emojis are superimposed over the subjects’ faces
(https://youtu.be/MDHtzOdnSgA). The results
demonstrate the feasibility of implementing neural networks
in real time to detect human emotion","The goal of this project was to implement real-time facial
emotion recognition. Using our custom trained VGG S network with a face-detector provided by OpenCV, we successfully implemented an application wherein an emoji indicating one of six expressions (anger, fear, neutral, happy, sad,
surpirse) is superimposed over a user’s face in real time (see
https://youtu.be/MDHtzOdnSgA for a demonstration). Some of the results are shown in Figure 14.
While we achieved a successful implementation, significant improvements can be made by addressing several key issues. First, a much larger dataset should be designed to
improve the model’s generality. While we achieved > 90%
accuracy in laboratory conditions (perfect lighting, camera
at eye level, subject facing camera with an exaggerated expression), any deviation from that caused the accuracy to
fall significantly. In particular, any shadow on a subject’s
face would cause an incorrect classification of ‘angry’. In
addition, the webcam needs to be level to the subjects’ faces
for accurate classification. Augmenting our home-brewed
dataset to include off-center faces could have addressed this
problem. Heavier pre-processing of the data would have
certainly improved test-time accuracy. For example, adjusting the brightness to the same level on all the images
might have removed the requirement for providing jittered
input images. Also, fully training a network other than
VGG S might yield substantial improvements in computation speed, since VGG S is relatively slow.
As mentioned previously, a particularly difficult aspect
of real-time recognition is deciding how to classify transition frames from neutral to fully formed expressions of
emotion. One viable solution is to use a running average of
the top classes reported by each frame which would ameliorate the problem of noise/errors caused by dynamic expressions [15]. Unfortunately, the relatively slow frame-rate of
our demonstration made this solution untenable. Regardless, our implementation appeared to classify a subject’s
emotion reliably. Future implementations that run at higher
frame-rates would require a running average.
Our project was implemented under Python 2.7 and the
source code can be downloaded from a github repository",Deep Learning and Machine Learning,"The article discusses the development of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for real-time facial emotion recognition, which was achieved using transfer learning on a pre-trained CNN for human emotion classification.

242,,Creation of a new set of dynamic virtual reality faces for the assessment and training of facial emotion recognition ability,,"The ability to recognize facial emotions is target behaviour when treating people with social impairment. When assessing this ability, the most widely used facial stimuli are photographs. Although their use has been shown to be valid, photographs are unable to capture the dynamic aspects of human expressions. This limitation can be overcome by creating virtual agents with feasible expressed emotions. The main objective of the present study was to create a new set of dynamic virtual faces with high realism that could be integrated into a virtual reality (VR) cyberintervention to train people with schizophrenia in the full repertoire of social skills. A set of highly realistic virtual faces was created based on the Facial Action Coding System. Facial movement animation was also included so as to mimic the dynamism of human facial expressions. Consecutive healthy participants (n = 98) completed a facial emotion recognition task using both natural faces (photographs) and virtual agents expressing five basic emotions plus a neutral one. Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed no significant difference in participants’ accuracy of recognition between the two presentation conditions. However, anger was better recognized in the VR images, and disgust was better recognized in photographs. Age, the participant’s gender and reaction times were also explored. Implications of the use of virtual agents with realistic human expressions in cyberinterventions are discussed.","In sum, the results show that VR faces are as valid as standardized natural faces for accurately recreating human-like facial expressions of emotions.

The present findings demonstrate that VR environments enable the introduction of virtual agents that can be created using feasible faces and other interpersonal communication cues (sounds, laughs, affect prosody), and this has obvious applications in relation to emotional and social training. As the virtual character’s morphology, external appearance and movements in time and space can be changed and controlled externally, virtual agents and environments have become a powerful tool for experimental psychology (Loomis et al. 1999). The findings also have several clinical implications, since the advances being made through virtual reality technology can help to overcome some of the limitations associated with the use of static faces. In addition, this technology is able to simulate social encounters: for example, using virtual reality with a correct pattern of emotional characters could generate alternative social environments. Virtual reality also allows therapists to control and manipulate the avatar’s behaviour in order to provide immediate feedback to people suffering from emotional and behavioural disorders, such as schizophrenia or social anxiety disorder. Our research group is currently using the task described here with psychotic patients, and the preliminary results show that virtual faces are a useful tool not only for assessing the ability of patients with schizophrenia to recognize emotions, but also for studying the clinical, cognitive and personality characteristics which underlie this impairment (Gutiérrez-Maldonado et al. 2012).

Several limitations of the present study need to be acknowledged. Firstly, it has to be stressed in this context that several studies have shown that dynamic and static facial expressions are processed differently neurologically (Collignon et al. 2008). This has to be considered an important limitation when comparing both facial stimuli. However, to the best of our knowledge, no well-validated set of dynamic video sequences is available to the research community that permits a reliable comparison with the virtual faces. Furthermore, the purpose of the present study was to examine the feasibility of the created virtual faces as well as their evaluation as perceived social agents, rather than the exploration of the neural mechanism involved in the facial emotion capability. Secondly, the predominance of women in the sample may constitute a weakness, even though no significant effect of participants’ gender was found. Thirdly, although culture is known to be an important variable when studying emotion (Russell 1994), this aspect was not included in the analysis of the present data. However, some authors in this field consider that social cognition needs to be carefully differentiated in relation to cultural influences and should be seen as a “universal” category enabling humans to develop language, culture or technology (Tomasello et al. 2005). Finally, only six expressions of emotions were included in the study, and some authors consider that these correspond to only a small number of basic emotions with prototypical expressions produced by neuromotor programs (Scherer and Ellgring 2007).

Despite these limitations, the present study adds to the existing literature on the application of virtual reality in the context of research, assessment and psychotherapy for psychiatric and psychological disorders. As mentioned before, the next stage of our research will be to include the virtual agents as social virtual entities in our VR social skills training programme: the Soskitrain (for a further description of the programme, see Rus-Calafell et al. 2012).

243,,Effects of facial emotion recognition remediation on visual scanning of novel face stimuli,,"Previous research shows that emotion recognition in schizophrenia can be improved with targeted remediation that draws attention to important facial features (eyes, nose, mouth). Moreover, the effects of training have been shown to last for up to one month after training. The aim of this study was to investigate whether improved emotion recognition of novel faces is associated with concomitant changes in visual scanning of these same novel facial expressions. Thirty-nine participants with schizophrenia received emotion recognition training using Ekman's Micro-Expression Training Tool (METT), with emotion recognition and visual scanpath (VSP) recordings to face stimuli collected simultaneously. Baseline ratings of interpersonal and cognitive functioning were also collected from all participants. Post-METT training, participants showed changes in foveal attention to the features of facial expressions of emotion not used in METT training, which were generally consistent with the information about important features from the METT. In particular, there were changes in how participants looked at the features of facial expressions of emotion surprise, disgust, fear, happiness, and neutral, demonstrating that improved emotion recognition is paralleled by changes in the way participants with schizophrenia viewed novel facial expressions of emotion. However, there were overall decreases in foveal attention to sad and neutral faces that indicate more intensive instruction might be needed for these faces during training. Most importantly, the evidence shows that participant gender may affect training outcomes.","The aim of this study was to determine whether the improved emotion recognition of novel face stimuli we found in our previous ERT study (Marsh et al., 2010), would be associated with concomitant changes in simultaneously recorded VSPs in schizophrenia.

244,,Facial emotion recognition,,"The interest on emotional computing has been increasing as many applications were in demand by multiple markets. This paper mainly focuses on different learning methods, and has implemented several methods: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM) for facial emotion recognition. The training and testing data sets of facial emotion prediction are from FERA 2015, and geometric features and appearance features are combined together. Different prediction systems are developed and the prediction results are compared. This paper aims to design an suitable system for facial emotion recognition.","Comparing these three different fusion strategies, simple accumulating different feature sets as feature-level fusion ignores the different information in time and space for different features. At the same time, finding an appropriate joint feature vectors is still an unsolved problem. For model-level fusion, achieving multi-time-scale labeling multimodal fusion is still an unsolved problem.

245,,Facial Emotion Recognition Using Transfer Learning in the Deep CNN,convolutional neural network (CNN); deep CNN; emotion recognition; transfer learning,"Human facial emotion recognition (FER) has attracted the attention of the research community for its promising applications. Mapping different facial expressions to the respective emotional states are the main task in FER. The classical FER consists of two major steps: feature extraction and emotion recognition. Currently, the Deep Neural Networks, especially the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is widely used in FER by virtue of its inherent feature extraction mechanism from images. Several works have been reported on CNN with only a few layers to resolve FER problems. However, standard shallow CNNs with straightforward learning schemes have limited feature extraction capability to capture emotion information from high-resolution images. A notable drawback of the most existing methods is that they consider only the frontal images (i.e., ignore profile views for convenience), although the profile views taken from different angles are important for a practical FER system. For developing a highly accurate FER system, this study proposes a very Deep CNN (DCNN) modeling through Transfer Learning (TL) technique where a pre-trained DCNN model is adopted by replacing its dense upper layer(s) compatible with FER, and the model is fine-tuned with facial emotion data. A novel pipeline strategy is introduced, where the training of the dense layer(s) is followed by tuning each of the pre-trained DCNN blocks successively that has led to gradual improvement of the accuracy of FER to a higher level. The proposed FER system is verified on eight different pre-trained DCNN models (VGG-16, VGG-19, ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, ResNet-152, Inception-v3 and DenseNet-161) and well-known KDEF and JAFFE facial image datasets. FER is very challenging even for frontal views alone. FER on the KDEF dataset poses further challenges due to the diversity of images with different profile views together with frontal views. The proposed method achieved remarkable accuracy on both datasets with pre-trained models. On a 10-fold cross-validation way, the best achieved FER accuracies with DenseNet-161 on test sets of KDEF and JAFFE are 96.51% and 99.52%, respectively. The evaluation results reveal the superiority of the proposed FER system over the existing ones regarding emotion detection accuracy. Moreover, the achieved performance on the KDEF dataset with profile views is promising as it clearly demonstrates the required proficiency for real-life applications.","In this study, an efficient DCNN using TL with pipeline tuning strategy has been proposed for emotion recognition from facial images. According to the experimental results, using eight different pre-trained DCNN models on well-known KDEF and JAFFE emotion datasets with different profile views, the proposed method shows very high recognition accuracy. In the present study, experiments conducted with general settings regardless of the pre-trained DCNN model for simplicity and a few confusing facial images, mostly profile views, are misclassified. Further fine-tuning hyperparameters of individual pre-trained models and extending special attention to profile views might enhance the classification accuracy. The current research, especially the performance with profile views, will be compatible with broader real-life industry applications, such as monitoring patients in the hospital or surveillance security. Moreover, the idea of facial emotion recognition may be extended to emotion recognition from speech or body movements to cover emerging industrial applications.",Deep Learning and Machine Learning,"This paper discusses the challenges of human facial emotion recognition (FER) and proposes a very Deep CNN (DCNN) modeling approach through Transfer Learning (TL) technique to improve FER accuracy.

This paper employs the Convolutional Neural Network and Deep Neural Network to develop a facial emotion recognition model that categorizes a facial expression into seven different emotions categorized as Afraid, Angry, Disgusted, Happy, Neutral, Sad and Surprised. This paper compares the performance of two existing deep neural network architectures with our proposed architecture, namely the Venturi Architecture in terms of training accuracy, training loss, testing accuracy and testing loss. This paper uses the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces dataset which is a set of 4900 pictures of human facial expressions. Two layers of feature maps were used to convolute the features from the images, and then it was passed on to the deep neural network with up to 6 hidden layers. The proposed Venturi architecture shows significant accuracy improvement compared to the modified triangular architecture and the rectangular architecture.","In this paper, three different architecture for the deep neural network of the convolutional neural networks i.e. The Rectangular Architecture, The Modified Triangular Architecture [9] and the newly proposed Venturi Architecture were analyzed for their training accuracy, testing or validation accuracy, training loss, testing or validation loss.

There is strong evidence for the universal facial expressions of eight emotions which include: neutral happy, sadness, anger, contempt, disgust, fear, and surprise. So it is very important to detect these emotions on the face as it has wide applications in the field of Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence. These fields are researching on the facial emotions to get the sentiments of the humans automatically. In Robotics, emotions classification can be used to enhance human-robot interactions since the robot is capable of interpreting a human reaction [13]. In this paper, the emotion detection has been done in both real-time and static images. In this project, we have used the Cohn-Kanade Database (CK) and the Extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) database, which comprises many static images 640 × 400 pixels and for the real-time using the webcam. The target expression for each sequence in the datasets are fully FACS (Facial action coding system) coded and emotion labels have been revised and validated [3]. So for emotion recognition initially we need to detect the faces by using HAAR filter from OpenCV in the static images or in the real-time videos. Once the face is detected it can be cropped and processed for further detection of facial landmarks. Then using facial landmarks the datasets are trained using the machine learning algorithm (Support Vector Machine) and then classified according to the eight emotions [1]. Using SVM we were getting the accuracy of around 93.7%. These facial landmarks can be modified for getting better accuracy.","In this paper, we presented the fully automatic recognition of facial emotions using the computer vision and machine learning algorithms which classify these eight different emotions. We tried many algorithms for the classification but the best which came out of the results was the support vectors machines with the accuracy of around 94.1%. Our results imply that user independent, fully automatic real-time coding of facial expressions in the continuous video stream is an achievable goal with present power of the computer, at least for applications in which frontal views can be assumed using the webcam. This machine learning based system for the emotion recognition can be extended to the deep learning system using the Convolutional Neural networks which will have many layers and the chances of getting much higher accuracy is there around 99.5% [2]. This project can be extended in which it will detect as many emotions of different people in one frame in the real-time videos [8]. Emotion recognition is going to be very useful in the near future in the research field of robotics and artificial Intelligence for example if a robot can sense the sentiment of any human and that robot can act accordingly without any intervention of any other humans. This automatic machine learning system for emotion recognition can also be extended with the detection of mixed emotions other than these eight universal emotions.",Deep Learning and Machine Learning,The paper discusses the importance of facial expression recognition in computer vision and artificial intelligence.

248,,Deep spatial-temporal feature fusion for facial expression recognition in static images,Facial expression recognitionDeep neural networkOptical flowSpatial-temporal feature fusionTransfer learning,"Traditional methods of performing facial expression recognition commonly use hand-crafted spatial features. This paper proposes a multi-channel deep neural network that learns and fuses the spatial-temporal features for recognizing facial expressions in static images. The essential idea of this method is to extract optical flow from the changes between the peak expression face image (emotional-face) and the neutral face image (neutral-face) as the temporal information of a certain facial expression, and use the gray-level image of emotional-face as the spatial information. A Multi-channel Deep Spatial-Temporal feature Fusion neural Network (MDSTFN) is presented to perform the deep spatial-temporal feature extraction and fusion from static images. Each channel of the proposed method is fine-tuned from a pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) instead of training a new CNN from scratch. In addition, average-face is used as a substitute for neutral-face in real-world applications. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method on benchmarks databases including CK+, MMI, and RaFD. The results show that the optical flow information from emotional-face and neutral-face is a useful complement to spatial feature and can effectively improve the performance of facial expression recognition from static images. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method can achieve better recognition accuracy, with rates of 98.38% on the CK+ database, 99.17% on the RaFD database, and 99.59% on the MMI database, respectively.","This paper presented a deep neural network architecture with multi-channels to extract and fuse the spatial-temporal features of static image for FER.

The feature extraction channels of the MDSTFN (Multi-channel Deep Spatial-Temporal feature Fusion neural Network) are fine-tuned from a pre-trained CNN model. This transfer learning scheme can not only obtain a better feature extractor for FER on a small number of image samples but can also reduce the risk of overfitting. Three kinds of strategies were investigated to fuse the temporal and spatial features obtained by multiple feature channels. On three benchmark databases (CK+, RaFD, and MMI), extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed method under various parameters such as channel combination, fusion strategy, cross-database, and pre-trained CNN models. The results show that the MDSTFN-based method is a feasible deep spatial-temporal feature extraction architecture for facial expression recognition.

Emotion recognition","Automatic recognition and interpretation of human emotions are becoming an integral part of intelligent products and services, which can lead to a breakthrough in domains such as healthcare, marketing, security, education and environment. This leads us towards Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems, whose main objective is to detect an expressed emotion and recognize the same. The proposed work introduces an FER system, which models the relationship between human facial expression and corresponding induced emotion for static images by extracting shape and appearance features. Automatic interpretation of facial expressions from static images is very challenging, as information available in a static image is less when compared with image sequences. Proposed method incites efficient extraction of shape and appearance features from still images for varying facial expressions using Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed for classification. The proposed work is implemented on Cohn-kanade data set for six basic expressions (happy, sad, surprise, anger, fear and disgust). Results show that identification of human expressions from static images has a better detection rate when shape and appearance features are used rather than texture or geometric features. Use of HOG for feature extraction makes the FER system robust, and real time implementation is made much easier.","The proposed work shows how HOG features can be exploited for facial expression recognition. Use of HOG features make the performance of FER system to be subject independent. The accuracy of the work is found be 92.56% when implemented using Cohn-kanade dataset for six basic expressions. Results indicate that shape features on face carry more information for emotion modelling when compared with texture and geometric features. Shape features are better when compared with geometric features due to the fact that a small pose variation degrades the performance of FER system which relies on geometric features where as a small pose variation doesn't reflect any changes on a FER system which relies on HOG features. Detection rates for disgust, fear and sad is less in the proposed work. Detection rates can be further improved by combining shape, texture and geometric features. Optimized cell sizes may be considered for real time implementation so as to address both detection rate and processing speed. The influence of non-frontal face on the performance of FER system could be addressed in the future work.",Deep Learning and Machine Learning,"The paper discusses the importance of facial expression recognition (FER) in various domains and introduces an FER system that uses Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification.

Training data","With the transition of facial expression recognition (FER) from laboratory-controlled to challenging in-the-wild conditions and the recent success of deep learning techniques in various fields, deep neural networks have increasingly been leveraged to learn discriminative representations for automatic FER. Recent deep FER systems generally focus on two important issues: overfitting caused by a lack of sufficient training data and expression-unrelated variations, such as illumination, head pose, and identity bias. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of deep FER, including datasets and algorithms that provide insights into these intrinsic problems. First, we introduce the available datasets that are widely used in the literature and provide accepted data selection and evaluation principles for these datasets. We then describe the standard pipeline of a deep FER system with the related background knowledge and suggestions for applicable implementations for each stage. For the state-of-the-art in deep FER, we introduce existing novel deep neural networks and related training strategies that are designed for FER based on both static images and dynamic image sequences and discuss their advantages and limitations. Competitive performances and experimental comparisons on widely used benchmarks are also summarized. We then extend our survey to additional related issues and application scenarios. Finally, we review the remaining challenges and corresponding opportunities in this field as well as future directions for the design of robust deep FER systems.","As the FER literature shifts its main focus to the challenging in-the-wild environmental conditions, many researchers have committed to employing deep learning technologies to handle difficulties, such as illumination variation, occlusions, nonfrontal head poses, identity bias and the recognition of low-intensity expressions. Given that FER is a data-driven task and that training a sufficiently deep network to capture subtle expression-related deformations requires a large amount of training data, the major challenge that deep FER systems face is the lack of training data in terms of both quantity and quality.

Because people of different age ranges, cultures and genders display and interpret facial expression in different ways, an ideal facial expression dataset is expected to include abundant sample images with precise face attribute labels, not just expression but other attributes such as age, gender and ethnicity, which would facilitate related research on cross-age range, cross-gender and cross-cultural FER using deep learning techniques, such as multitask deep networks and transfer learning. In addition, although occlusion and multipose problems have received relatively wide interest in the field of deep face recognition, occlusion-robust and pose-invariant issues have received less attention in deep FER. One of the main reasons is the lack of a sufficient facial expression dataset with occlusion type and head-pose annotations.

On the other hand, accurately annotating a large volume of image data with the large variation and complexity of natural scenarios is an obvious impediment to the construction of expression datasets. A reasonable approach is to employ crowd-sourcing models [34], [45], [208] under the guidance of expert annotators. Additionally, a fully automatic labeling tool [43] refined by experts is an alternative to provide approximate but efficient annotations. In both cases, a subsequent reliable estimation or labeling learning process is necessary to filter out noisy annotations. In particular, few comparatively large-scale datasets that consider real-world scenarios and contain a wide range of facial expressions have recently become publicly available, i.e., EmotioNet [43], RAF-DB [34], [44] and AffectNet [45], and we anticipate that with advances in technology and the widespread of the Internet, more complementary facial expression datasets will be constructed to promote the development of deep FER.",Deep Learning and Machine Learning,"This article discusses the use of deep neural networks for facial expression recognition (FER) under challenging in-the-wild conditions.

252,,An Overview of Sentiment Analysis in Social Media and its Applications in Disaster Relief,"Sentiment Analysis, Disaster Relief, Visualization, Social Media","Sentiment analysis refers to the class of computational and natural language processing based techniques used to identify, extract or characterize subjective information, such as opinions, expressed in a given piece of text. The main purpose of sentiment analysis is to classify a writer’s attitude towards various topics into positive, negative or neutral categories. Sentiment analysis has many applications in different domains including, but not limited to, business intelligence, politics, sociology, etc. Recent years, on the other hand, have witnessed the advent of social networking websites, microblogs, wikis and Web applications and consequently, an unprecedented growth in user-generated data is poised for sentiment mining. Data such as web-postings, Tweets, videos, etc., all express opinions on various topics and events, offer immense opportunities to study and analyze human opinions and sentiment. In this chapter, we study the information published by individuals in social media in cases of natural disasters and emergencies and investigate if such information could be used by first responders to improve situational awareness and crisis management. In particular, we explore applications of sentiment analysis and demonstrate how sentiment mining in social media can be exploited to determine how local crowds react during a disaster, and how such information can be used to improve disaster management. Such information can also be used to help assess the extent of the devastation and find people who are in specific need during an emergency situation. We first provide the formal definition of sentiment analysis in social media and cover traditional and the state-of-the-art approaches while highlighting contributions, shortcomings, and pitfalls due to the composition of online media streams. Next we discuss the relationship among social media, disaster relief and situational awareness and explain how social media is used in these contexts with the focus on sentiment analysis. In order to enable quick analysis of real-time geo-distributed data, we will detail applications of visual analytics with an emphasis on sentiment visualization. Finally, we conclude the chapter with a discussion of research challenges in sentiment analysis and its application in disaster relief.","ness, while we also detailed applications of visual analytics with an emphasis on sentiment analysis. In this section we discuss some of the challenges facing the studies in sentiment analysis and its application in disaster relief, as well as visual analytics, as potential research directions for further considerations. Despite few works that have exploited network information such as followee-follower networks and @-networks for more accurate sentiment analysis, majority of the works have not incorporated such useful information; they have considered the problem of sentiment analysis with solely taking into account the lexicon or linguistic based features. One potential avenue of future work is to deploy extra information such as emotional correlation information including spatial-temporal patterns and homophily effect as a measurement of sentiment of social media posts. For example, during winters, people in Florida are expected to be happier than people in Wisconsin. Also, homophily effect suggest that similar people might behave in a more similar way than other people regarding a specific event. Moreover, as the task of collecting sentiment labels in social media is extremely time consuming and tedious, unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches are required to reduce the cost of sentiment classification. Although some studies have addressed this issue, the literature is premature in this realm and still lacks strong contributions. For example, future studies could explore the contributions of other available emotion indications in social media such as product ratings and reviews. Most studies in disaster relief have used plain machine learning techniques with simple lexicon features. Therefore, more complex machine learning based approaches along with stronger features are required. Furthermore, leveraging the findings of psychological and sociological studies on individuals’ behaviors (e.g. hope, fear) during disasters, could be another interesting research direction. This additional information could help better understand people’s behaviors and feelings during disasters and also help decision makers know how they can handle this situation. Investigating how this information could be preprocessed to be immediately usable by corresponding authorities, is another interesting future research direction. Furthermore, visualization techniques need to be improved to allow for real time visual analytics of disasters related posts in order to help first responders easily track the changes during disasters and make proper and quick decisions.",sentiment analysis,"Sentiment analysis is a technique used to identify and extract subjective information such as opinions expressed in text.

Figure 10. 13 May 2020 Part of the dataSet of the ‘covid’ keyword. JOURNAL OF INFORMATION AND TELECOMMUNICATION 13 has been combined with a keyword-based special data scraper, so we can apply our taught RNN model with these specific freshly scraped datasets. As a result, we get an emotional classification related to specific topics. What kind of tweets they were and what emotional class they belong to, what is the distribution on that topic at the emotional level within the given start interval. In the article, we focused most on the coronavirus and related emotional changes and fluctuations, and it was shown that the overall positive manifestation and presence on the social platform remained on social media surfaces during this pandemic. Of course, in addition to negative and other manifestations. Over time, positivity has strengthened, but there is also a stronger negative array that is natural. According to our expectations this topic remain positive manifestations, sometimes with a higher and sometimes with a smaller percentage. It can be seen that the recurrent neural network provides good performance and prediction in text classification. Where the RNN model brought a smaller amount of data in neutral result or completely reduced to zero that. Which proves that our model is ‘able to make’ a decision and categorize in some direction even on the basis of small details. Our comparisons were made mainly against TextBlob, which also worked very well and delivered stable results, but there were many times when the neutral results were above 30% compared to our RNN model, which we cannot use as usefully for further evaluations as for our RNN model. The classification of emotions for both models (TextBlob, RNN) was properly segmented. For future work and further development, it may be advisable to create an interface that better visualizes and interacts with users, which can be supplemented with sophisticated database management for archiving, tracking, and exploring datas to other areas. We can further expand the analysis by introducing various classifications and clusters as well as other data analyses. Allowing examinations and comparisons from a new perspective, in addition to emotional analyses, may even provide an opportunity to further support current results and compare the conclusions.

254,,Social Media Analytics: Analysis and Visualisation of News Diffusion using NodeXL,"Social Media, Social Network Analysis, Twitter, Information Diffusion","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of NodeXL in the context of news diffusion. Journalists often include a social media dimension in their stories but lack the tools to get digital photos of the virtual crowds about which they write. NodeXL is an easy to use tool for collecting, analysing, visualizing, and reporting on the patterns found in collections of connections in streams of social media. With a network map patterns emerge that highlight key people, groups, divisions and bridges, themes and related resources. Design/methodology/approach: This study conducts a literature review of previous empirical work which has utilised NodeXL and highlights the potential of NodeXL to provide network insights of virtual crowds during emerging news events. It then develops a number of guidelines which can be utlised by news media teams to measure and map information diffusion during emerging news events. Findings: One emergent software application known as NodeXL has allowed journalists to take ‘group photos’ of the connections among a group of users on social media. It was found that a diverse range of disciplines utilise NodeXL in academic research. Furthermore based on the features of NodeXL a number of guidelines were developed which provide insight into how to measure and map emerging news events on Twitter. Social implications: With a set of social media network images a journalist can cover a set of social media content streams and quickly grasp ""situational awareness"" of the shape of the crowd. Since social media popular support is often cited but not documented, NodeXL social media network maps can help journalists quickly document the social landscape utilising an innovative approach. Originality/value: This is the first empirical study to review literature on NodeXL, and to provide insight into the value of network visualisations and analytics for the news media domain. Moreover, it is the first empirical study to develop guidelines that will act as a valuable resource for newsrooms looking to acquire insight into emerging news events from the stream of social media posts. In the era of fake news and automated accounts i.e., bots the ability to highlight opinion leaders and ascertain their allegiances will be of importance in today’s news climate.","This paper has provided an overview of some of the diverse uses of NodeXL from across a number of academic disciplines. The abstract provides an interesting starting point in reviewing the literature utilising NodeXL for research purposes. Now, as social media platforms become more and more popular it is critically important to study them. An interesting feature of NodeXL is that it requires no technical and/or programming knowledge which potentially allows it to be utlised across a wide range of disciplines from science and engineering, the social sciences, and the humanities.",nodeXL,"This paper provides an overview of NodeXL, a tool for collecting, analyzing, visualizing, and reporting on social media connections.

Taking advantage of the amount of information is now available, research and industry have sought ways to automatically analyze sentiments and user opinions expressed in social networks. In this paper, we place ourselves in a difficult context, on the sentiments that could thinking of suicide. In particular, we propose to address the lack of terminological resources related to suicide by a method of constructing a vocabulary associated with suicide. We then propose, for a better analysis, to investigate Weka as a tool of data mining based on machine learning algorithms that can extract useful information from Twitter data collected by Twitter4J. Therefore, an algorithm of computing semantic analysis between tweets in training set and tweets in data set based on WordNet is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method based on machine learning algorithms and semantic sentiment analysis can extract predictions of suicidal ideation using Twitter Data. In addition, this work verify the effectiveness of performance in term of accuracy and precision on semantic sentiment analysis that could thinking of suicide.","As part of this work, we present our potentially method based on different machine learning for using the social network Twitter as a preventive force in the fight against suicide.

256,,Social media sentiment analysis: lexicon versus machine learning,"Sentiment analysis, Social media, Consumer-generated content","Purpose – With the soaring volumes of brand-related social media conversations, digital marketers have extensive opportunities to track and analyse consumers’ feelings and opinions about brands, products or services embedded within consumer-generated content (CGC). These “Big Data” opportunities render manual approaches to sentiment analysis impractical and raise the need to develop automated tools to analyse consumer sentiment expressed in text format. This paper aims to evaluate and compare the performance of two prominent approaches to automated sentiment analysis applied to CGC on social media and explores the benefits of combining them. Design/methodology/approach – A sample of 850 consumer comments from 83 Facebook brand pages are used to test and compare lexicon-based and machine learning approaches to sentiment analysis, as well as their combination, using the LIWC2015 lexicon and RTextTools machine learning package. Findings – Results show the two approaches are similar in accuracy, both achieving higher accuracy when classifying positive sentiment than negative sentiment. However, they differ substantially in their classification ensembles. The combined approach demonstrates significantly improved performance in classifying positive sentiment. Research limitations/implications – Further research is required to improve the accuracy of negative sentiment classification. The combined approach needs to be applied to other kinds of CGCs on social media such as tweets. Practical implications – The findings inform decision-making around which sentiment analysis approaches (or a combination thereof) is best to analyse CGC on social media. Originality/value – This study combines two sentiment analysis approaches and demonstrates significantly improved performance","when applied on social media conversations, the two automated approaches have similar performance. Second, we demonstrate that combining the different approaches significantly improves classification performance in terms of precision and recall for positive sentiment. This finding suggests the great potential of a combined approach to gain deeper insights into positive social media conversations. Given the soaring volumes of brand-related social media conversations and the lack of guidance as to what tools are adequate to analyse such “Big Data”, our study fills a gap in the literature and adds to industry best practices. Our findings form the basis of decision-making around which approach is best for marketers to analyse consumers’ social media conversations and how to best combine approaches to achieve better outcome.

Furthermore, we evaluate state-of-the-art supervised machine learning methods for sentiment analysis. We explore different pre-processing techniques and employ various features and classifiers. Moreover, in addition to our newly created social media dataset, we also report results on other widely popular domains, such as movie and product reviews.

We improve over previous reviews with wider coverage from 2017 to 2020 as well as a study focused on the underlying ideas and commonalities behind the different solutions to achieve multilingual sentiment analysis. Interesting findings of our research are (i) the shift of research interest to cross-lingual and code-switching approaches, (ii) the apparent stagnation of the less complex architectures derived from a backbone featuring an embedding layer, a feature extractor based on a single CNN or LSTM and a classifier, (iii) the lack of approaches tackling multilingual aspect-based sentiment analysis through deep learning, and, surprisingly, (iv) the lack of more complex architectures such as the transformers-based, despite results suggest the more difficult tasks requires more elaborated architectures","In this work, we reviewed 24 that studied 23 and 11 different languages and sources. The observed trend evidences the steady interest in this domain, so we expect to see this direction continue. As regards the different MSA setups, the multilingual approach seems to be decreasing in interest. However, aspect-based sentiment analysis is still an understudied domain and an open research field with a lot of scope for future works. We highlighted the main ideas authors proposed to tackle the challenge that represents the lack of annotated data or to achieve language independent models. Despite state-of-the-art results in some cases, the simpler backbone comprising embeddings, a feature extractor, and a classifier seems to be unappropriated for more complex scenarios. Also, there are unsolved questions such as which type of embedding captures better the particulars of MSA. We hint about future research directions, for example, if ideas such as contextualized embeddings, which have proven very useful in other tasks, can further improve MSA. Finally, although studies have covered very different languages such as Arabic, Chinese, or Hindi, the world is extraordinarily rich in languages, cultures, and ways of expressing feelings. Thus, better approaches need to be assessed or developed for new scenarios.",sentiment analysis,"The text discusses a review of 24 studies on multilingual sentiment analysis of social media in 23 different languages from 2017 to 2020.

Data mining is the process of analyzing data from different context and summarizes them into useful information. It allows the users to analyze the data, categorize them and identifies the relationship inferred in them. Text mining often referred to as text data mining can be used to derive information from text. Text analysis can be used in information retrieval, information extraction, pattern recognition, frequency distribution and data mining techniques. An application of this is to scan a set of documents in natural language for predictive classification purposes. Recent researches shows that the number of crimes are increasing through social media that may cause tremendous loss to organizations. Existing security methods are weak in cyber crime forensics and predictions. The contribution of this paper is to mine cybercriminal network which can reveal both implicit and explicit meanings among cybercriminal based on their conversation messages","This paper analysis various generative models and network mining techniques that can be used to uncover the cybercriminal network. The ability to mine social media to extract relevant information is a crucial task. Since a great proportion of information contained in social media are in unstructured form, there is a need state-ofthe art tool to collect and apply intelligence methods .Existing cyber technologies are not effective and they are weak in cybercrime forensics. Here a novel context sensitive text mining method is recommended by which latent concepts are extracted and these latent concepts are subjected to extract the semantics which describes the cybercriminal relationships. This system can be enhanced by genetic algorithm. Genetic Algorithm is a robust search method requiring little information to search effectively in a large or poorlyunderstood search space.The working of genetic algorithm is as follow: First a population is created from a group of individuals and 3 International Journal of Computer Applications (0975 - 8887) Volume 134 - No.14, January 2016 then these individuals are evaluated. The evaluation is performed and each individual are given a fitness score based on which they are evaluated .Two individuals are selected based on their fitness score, higher the score greater the chance to be selected. This process continues until a best solution is obtained from a set of candidate solutions. Genetic algorithm takes the advantage of giving greater weight to individuals with best fitness score and concentrate the search in regions which leads to select the best topics. Genetic algorithm provides a heuristic search to solve optimization problems. Here Genetic algorithm provides a better solution in which more concepts can be extracted and time efficiency can be improved. By mining the network security intelligence in social media not only facilitates the cyber attack but also has an intelligence to predict the cyber attack before they can be launched.",text  mining,"The text discusses the increasing use of social media for sharing and gathering information, and the process of data mining to analyze and categorize this data.

One of the biggest challenges of CI is the emulation of human intelligence, which includes not only human-like reasoning but also human interaction, e.g., human language and human emotions. Emotions, sentiment, and judgments on the scale of good—bad, desirable—undesirable, approval—disapproval are essential for human-to-human communication. Understanding human emotions and deciphering the way humans reason about them or express them in their language is key to enhancing human-machine interaction","The paper shows how computational intelligence and linguistics can be blended in order to understand sentiment associated with the text. The presented approach combines the use of various linguistic patterns based on the syntactic structure of the sentences. Similarly to the function of electronic logic gates, the algorithm determines the polarity of each word and flows, or extends, it through the dependency arcs in order to determine the final polarity label of the sentence.

The future work will aim to discover more linguistic patterns, generalizing the patterns and use of deep learning for the CI module. In the future, we plan to carry out additional experiments using diverse datasets to further evaluate the domain independence of the capabilities of linguistic patterns, and compare their performance with other benchmark stateof-the-art approaches (such as [12]). Further, whilst our presumption is that all linguistic patterns are equally important for calculating the polarity of natural language sentences, it would be interesting to carry out further detailed theoretical analysis to investigate relative contributions of sentic patterns across a range of datasets from different domains. As discussed in Section VI-A, sarcasm detection plays an important role in sentiment analysis: irony usually inverts the polarity of the sentence. We plan to develop a sarcasm detection module trained on available datasets3 [39]. Identifying implicit negation [19] when irony is detected, is also one of the key future tasks of our framework.

In the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) provides accurate counts of fatal work injuries based on confirmation of work relationship from multiple sources, while the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) provides detailed data on fatal MVTCs based on police reports. Characterization of fatal work-related MVTCs is currently limited by data sources that lack either data on potential risk factors (CFOI) or work-relatedness confirmation and employment characteristics (FARS). BLS and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) collaborated to analyze a merged data file created by BLS using CFOI and FARS data. A matching algorithm was created to link 2010 data from CFOI and FARS using date of incident and other case characteristics, allowing for flexibility in variables to address coding discrepancies. Using the matching algorithm, 953 of the 1044 CFOI “Highway” cases (91%) for 2010 were successfully linked to FARS. Further analysis revealed systematic differences between cases identified as work-related by both systems and by CFOI alone. Among cases identified as work-related by CFOI alone, the fatally-injured worker was considerably more likely to have been employed outside the transportation and warehousing industry or transportation-related occupations, and to have been the occupant of a vehicle other than a heavy truck. This study is the first step of a collaboration between BLS, NHTSA, and NIOSH to improve the completeness and quality of data on fatal work-related MVTCs. It has demonstrated the feasibility and value of matching data on fatal work-related traffic crashes from CFOI and FARS.

264,,Recovery of 3D rib motion from dynamic chest radiography and CT data using local contrast normalization and articular motion model,2D–3D registration Rib motion analysis Articular motion model Local contrast normalization,"Dynamic chest radiography (2D x-ray video) is a low-dose and cost-effective functional imaging method with high temporal resolution. While the analysis of rib-cage motion has been shown to be effective for evaluating respiratory function, it has been limited to 2D. We aim at 3D rib-motion analysis for high temporal resolution while keeping the radiation dose at a level comparable to conventional examination. To achieve this, we developed a method for automatically recovering 3D rib motion based on 2D-3D registration of x-ray video and single-time-phase computed tomography. We introduce the following two novel components into the conventional intensity-based 2D–3D registration pipeline: (1) a rib-motion model based on a uniaxial joint to constrain the search space and (2) local contrast normalization (LCN) as a pre-process of x-ray video to improve the cost function of the optimization parameters, which is often called the landscape. The effects of each component on the registration results were quantitatively evaluated through experiments using simulated images and real patients’ x-ray videos obtained in a clinical setting. The rotation-angle error of the rib and the mean projection contour distance (mPCD) were used as the error metrics. The simulation experiments indicate that the proposed uniaxial joint model improved registration accuracy. By searching the rotation axis along with the rotation angle of the ribs, the rotation-angle error and mPCD significantly decreased from 2.246 ± 1.839° and 1.148 ± 0.743 mm to 1.495 ± 0.993° and 0.742 ± 0.281 mm, compared to simply applying De Troyer’s model. The real-image experiments with eight patients demonstrated that LCN improved the cost function space; thus, robustness in optimization resulting in an average mPCD of 1.255 ± 0.615 mm. We demonstrated that an anatomical knowledge based constraint and an intensity normalization, LCN, significantly improved robustness and accuracy in rib-motion reconstruction using chest x-ray video.","We proposed a robust 2D-3D registration method for 3D rib-motion recovery from dynamic radiography. Specifically, the contributions of this paper are the introduction of (1) a uniaxial rib-motion model together with the optimization of the rotation axis to improve robustness in optimization while maintaining a high degree of accuracy, and (2) the LCN in the pre-processing of x-ray video to better condition the cost function space. We evaluated the proposed method through simulation experiments using the two-time-phase CT (i.e., inhale and exhale phases) and real-image experiments using x-ray videos acquired with a protocol used in a routine clinical setting. In both simulation and real-image experiments, the optimization of the rotation axis yielded statistically significant improvement (p < 0.01) compared to the scenario without rotation-axis search. We also confirmed the effectiveness of LCN in the real-image experiments.",Medical Data Analysis,"The paper proposes a method for automatically recovering 3D rib motion from 2D x-ray videos, while keeping the radiation dose low.

265,,Improving dense conditional random field for retinal vessel segmentation by discriminative feature learning and thin-vessel enhancement,"Retinal vessel segmentation , Dense conditional random field , Convolutional neural network , Feature learning , Image enhancement.","Background and objectives: As retinal vessels in color fundus images are thin and elongated structures, standard pairwise based random fields, which always suffer the “shrinking bias” problem, are not competent for such segmentation task. Recently, a dense conditional random field (CRF) model has been successfully used in retinal vessel segmentation. Its corresponding energy function is formulated as a linear combination of several unary features and a pairwise term. However, the hand-crafted unary features can be suboptimal in terms of linear models. Here we propose to learn discriminative unary features and enhance thin vessels for pairwise potentials to further improve the segmentation performance. Methods: Our proposed method comprises four main steps: firstly, image preprocessing is applied to eliminate the strong edges around the field of view (FOV) and normalize the luminosity and contrast inside FOV; secondly, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is properly trained to generate discriminative features for linear models; thirdly, a combo of filters are applied to enhance thin vessels, reducing the intensity difference between thin and wide vessels; fourthly, by taking the discriminative features for unary potentials and the thin-vessel enhanced image for pairwise potentials, we adopt the dense CRF model to achieve the final retinal vessel segmentation. The segmentation performance is evaluated on four public datasets (i.e. DRIVE, STARE, CHASEDB1 and HRF). Results: Experimental results show that our proposed method improves the performance of the dense CRF model and outperforms other methods when evaluated in terms of F1-score, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and G-mean, three effective metrics for the evaluation of imbalanced binary classification. Specifically, the F1-score, MCC and G-mean are 0.7942, 0.7656, 0.8835 for the DRIVE dataset respectively; 0.8017, 0.7830, 0.8859 for STARE respectively; 0.7644, 0.7398, 0.8579 for CHASEDB1 respectively; and 0.7627, 0.7402, 0.8812 for HRF respectively. Conclusions: The discriminative features learned in CNNs are more effective than hand-crafted ones. Our proposed method performs well in retinal vessel segmentation. The architecture of our method is trainable and can be integrated into computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems in the future.","In this paper, we propose a retinal vessel segmentation method based on the dense CRF model. Discriminative unary features are learned from a CNN model, which is properly trained using the superpixel-level balanced sample selection.

Finally, the retinal vessel segmentation is achieved by efficient inference in the trained dense CRF model, which exploits the structural information of retinal vessels. Results show that our proposed method achieve better performance than the original dense CRF model with hand-crafted features, and that our method makes a general improvement in terms of F1-score, Matthews correlation coefficient and G-mean compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

266,,Small lung nodules detection based on local variance analysis and probabilistic neural network,"Chest X-ray screening , Biomedical image processing , Automatic pathology recognition , Probabilistic neural network.","Background and objective: In medical examinations doctors use various techniques in order to provide to the patients an accurate analysis of their actual state of health. One of the commonly used methodologies is the x-ray screening. This examination very often help to diagnose some diseases of chest organs. The most frequent cause of wrong diagnosis lie in the radiologist’s difficulty in interpreting the presence of lungs carcinoma in chest X-ray. In such circumstances, an automated approach could be highly advantageous as it provides important help in medical diagnosis. Methods: In this paper we propose a new classification method of the lung carcinomas. This method start with the localization and extraction of the lung nodules by computing, for each pixel of the original image, the local variance obtaining an output image (variance image) with the same size of the original image. In the variance image we find the local maxima and then by using the locations of these maxima in the original image we found the contours of the possible nodules in lung tissues. However after this segmentation stage we find many false nodules. Therefore to discriminate the true ones we use a probabilistic neural network as classifier. Results: The performance of our approach is 92% of correct classifications, while the sensitivity is 95% and the specificity is 89.7%. The misclassification errors are due to the fact that network confuses false nodules with the true ones (6%) and true nodules with the false ones (2%). Conclusions: Several researchers have proposed automated algorithms to detect and classify pulmonary nodules but these methods fail to detect low-contrast nodules and have a high computational complexity, in contrast our method is relatively simple but at the same time provides good results and can detect low-contrast nodules. Furthermore, in this paper is presented a new algorithm for training the PNN neural networks that allows to obtain PNNs with many fewer neurons compared to the neural networks obtained by using the training algorithms present in the literature. So considerably lowering the computational burden of the trained network and at same time keeping the same performances.","The proposed method is relatively simple, but at the same time provides good results.

The objective of this study is to develop and validate an analytical model incorporating actual cranial thickness and curvature for child aged 0–1YO and investigate their effects on child head dynamic responses at different head locations. Methods: To develop the new analytical model, the child head was simplified into an irregular fluid-filled shell with non-uniform thickness and the cranial thickness and curvature at different locations were automatically obtained from CT scans using a procedure developed in this study.

268,,Automatic delineation of ribs and clavicles in chest radiographs using fully convolutional DenseNets,"Chest radiograph , Rib and clavicle delineation , Fully convolutional DenseNet.","Background and Objective: In chest radiographs (CXRs), all bones and soft tissues are overlapping with each other, which raises issues for radiologists to read and interpret CXRs. Delineating the ribs and clavicles is helpful for suppressing them from chest radiographs so that their effects can be reduced for chest radiography analysis. However, delineating ribs and clavicles automatically is difficult by methods without deep learning models. Moreover, few of methods without deep learning models can delineate the anterior ribs effectively due to their faint rib edges in the posterior-anterior (PA) CXRs. Methods: In this work, we present an effective deep learning method for delineating posterior ribs, anterior ribs and clavicles automatically using a fully convolutional DenseNet (FC-DenseNet) as pixel classifier. We consider a pixel-weighted loss function to mitigate the uncertainty issue during manually delineating for robust prediction. Results: We conduct a comparative analysis with two other fully convolutional networks for edge detection and the state-of-the-art method without deep learning models. The proposed method significantly outperforms these methods in terms of quantitative evaluation metrics and visual perception. The average recall, precision and F-measure are 0.773 ± 0.030, 0.861 ± 0.043 and 0.814 ± 0.023 respectively, and the mean boundary distance (MBD) is 0.855 ± 0.642 pixels of the proposed method on the test dataset.

Diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy at an early stage can be done through the segmentation of blood vessels of the retina. In this work, the performance of descriptive statistical features in retinal vessel segmentation is evaluated by using fuzzy logic, an artificial neural network classifier (ANN), a support vector machine (SVM), and classifier fusion. Newly constructed eight features are formed by statistical moments. Mean and median measurements of image pixels’ intensity values in four directions, horizontal, vertical, up-diagonal, and down-diagonal, are calculated. Features, F1, F2, F3, and F4 are calculated as the mean values and F5, F6, F7, and F8 are calculated as the median values of a processed pixel in each direction. A fuzzy rule-based classifier, an ANN, a SVM, and a classifier fusion are designed. The publicly available DRIVE and STARE databases are used for evaluation. The fuzzy classifier achieved 93.82% of an overall accuracy, 72.28% of sensitivity, and 97.04% of specificity. For the ANN classifier, 94.2% of overall accuracy, 67.7% of sensitivity, and 98.1% of specificity are achieved on the DRIVE database.

Tens of millions of confirmed cases and more than hundreds of thousands of confirmed deaths are reported worldwide according to the World Health Organization. News about the virus is spreading all over social media websites. Consequently, these social media outlets are experiencing and presenting different views, opinions and emotions during various outbreak-related incidents. For computer scientists and researchers, big data are valuable assets for understanding people’s sentiments regarding current events, especially those related to the pandemic. Therefore, analyzing these sentiments will yield remarkable findings. To the best of our knowledge, previous related studies have focused on one kind of infectious disease. No previous study has examined multiple diseases via sentiment analysis. Accordingly, this research aimed to review and analyze articles about the occurrence of different types of infectious diseases, such as epidemics, pandemics, viruses or outbreaks, during the last 10 years, understand the application of sentiment analysis and obtain the most important literature findings. Articles on related topics were systematically searched in five major databases, namely, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore and Scopus, from 1 January 2010 to 30 June 2020. These indices were considered sufficiently extensive and reliable to cover our scope of the literature. Articles were selected based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria for the systematic review, with a total of n = 28 articles selected. All these articles were formed into a coherent taxonomy to describe the corresponding current standpoints in the literature in accordance with four main categories: lexicon-based models, machine learning based models, hybrid-based models and individuals. The obtained articles were categorized into motivations related to disease mitigation, data analysis and challenges faced by researchers with respect to data, social media platforms and community. Other aspects, such as the protocol being followed by the systematic review and demographic statistics of the literature distribution, were included in the review. Interesting patterns were observed in the literature, and the identified articles were grouped accordingly.

Discussion: Syria’s conflict has displaced more than half of its pre-war population, leaving 6.7 million people internally displaced. The consequent overcrowding – with insufficient water, sanitation and healthcare (including laboratory capacity) – could lead to conditions that are ideal for spread of SARSCoV-2 in Syria. Political changes have led to the formation of at least three health systems within Syria’s borders, each with its own governance, capacity and planning. This fragmentation, with little interaction between them, could lead to poor resource allocation and adversely affect control. As such, COVID-19 could overwhelm the health systems (particularly intensive care capacity), leading to high deaths across the population, particularly for the most vulnerable such as detainees. Conclusions: Locally implementable interventions that rapidly build WASH and health system capacity are required across Syria to ensure early detection and management of COVID-19 cases.","Countries affected by protracted conflict face numerous challenges with health systems that have already been decimated; as such, SARS-CoV-2 could spread rapidly through affected populations, particularly among those in the most vulnerable groups. In Syria, the multiple fragmented and increasingly politicized health systems within its borders present further challenges and the response requires locally appropriate interventions. Internationally recommended measures are unlikely to be enforceable or effective in areas where a lack of sanitation and overcrowding are rife; as such, rapid expansion of WASH and addressing shelter, particularly for internally displaced persons is needed. Ceasefires (as have occurred in Yemen), protection of health workers and health facilities, the expansion of humanitarian access through the remaining border crossings, and evacuation of critical cases for life-saving treatment are practicable measures that can support the response to COVID-19 in Syria.",Medical Data Analysis,"The article discusses the challenges that Syria faces in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic due to the country's protracted conflict, which has led to the fragmentation of its health systems and inadequate resources for water, sanitation, and healthcare.

275,,Measuring rib cortical bone thickness and cross section from CT,"Cortical bone , Rib , Computed tomography , Osteoporosis.","This study assesses the ability to measure local cortical bone thickness, and to obtain mechanically relevant properties of rib cross-sections from clinical-resolution computed tomography (CT) scans of human ribs. The study utilized thirty-four sections of ribs published by Perz et al. (2015) in three modalities: standard clinical CT (clinCT), high-resolution clinical CT (HRclinCT), and microCT (μCT). Clinical-resolution images were processed using a Cortical Bone Mapping (CBM) algorithm applied to cross-cortex signals resampled perpendicularly to an initial smooth periosteal border. Geometric constraints were applied to remove outlier signals from consideration, and final predicted periosteal and endosteal borders from HRclinCT and clinCT were developed. Target values for local cortical thickness and for overall cross-sectional area and inertial properties were obtained from segmentation of the periosteal and endosteal borders on each corresponding μCT image. Errors in prediction (mean ± SD) of local cortical bone thickness for HRclinCT and clinCT resolutions were −0.03 ± 0.17 mm and −0.05 ± 0.22 mm, respectively, with R2 coefficients of determination from linear regression of 0.82 and 0.71 (p < 0.0001 for both). Predicted cortical shell measures derived from the periosteal and endosteal borders included total cross-sectional area (prediction errors of 6 ± 3% and −1 ± 5% respectively for HRclinCT and clinCT with R2 correlations of 0.99 and 0.96), cortical shell area (errors of −3 ± 8% and −8 ± 11% with R2 correlations of 0.91 and 0.87), and principal area moment of inertia (errors of 2 ± 8% and −3 ± 11% with R2 correlations of 0.98 and 0.95). Results here show substantial reductions in rib cross-sectional measurement error compared to past histogram-based thresholding methods and provide first validation of the CBM method when applied to rib bones. With the ubiquity of clinical CT scans covering the thorax and ribs, this study opens the door for individualized and population-wide quantification of rib structural properties and their corresponding effects on rib injury.","Numerical models of the thorax are increasingly being used to help understand and mitigate traumatic injuries. Advancement of these models depends on detailed and accurate anatomic information, particularly from key structural components such as ribs. Models are routinely generated from clinical CT imaging, yet the limited resolution of these images has restricted the geometric detail that can be directly obtained. This study has applied current Cortical Bone Mapping (CBM) techniques to rib sections to directly assess the accuracy of local cortex thickness measurement and detailed cross-sectional property measurement when taken using clinical-resolution CT scans. The accuracy of these techniques has been tested against target values (obtained from μCT) for rib overall cross-sectional area, rib cortical cross-sectional area, and rib local cortical bone thickness. Results show substantial reductions in measurement error of cross-sectional rib properties when using CBM compared to previous work. The accuracy and precision of rib cortical bone thickness measurements using the current methodology was also marginally higher when compared to bone thickness measures taken from other regions of the body. This accuracy allows researchers to obtain multiple geometric properties from clinical CT images without the need for more restrictive sources such as microCT.",Medical Data Analysis,"This study evaluates the ability to measure local cortical bone thickness and obtain mechanically relevant properties of rib cross-sections from clinical-resolution CT scans of human ribs using a Cortical Bone Mapping (CBM) algorithm.

Smartphones can be a useful tool for detecting prodromal symptoms of episode recurrence (through real-time monitoring) and providing options for early intervention between outpatient visits. Aims: The aim of this systematic review is to overview and discuss the studies on the smartphone-based systems that monitor or detect the phase change in BD. We also discuss the challenges concerning predictive modelling. Methods: Published studies were identified through searching the electronic databases. Predictive attributes reflecting illness activity were evaluated including data from patients' self-assessment ratings and objectively measured data collected via smartphone. Articles were reviewed according to PRISMA guidelines. Results: Objective data automatically collected using smartphones (voice data from phone calls and smartphone usage data reflecting social and physical activities) are valid markers of a mood state. The articles surveyed reported accuracies in the range of 67% to 97% in predicting mood status. Various machine learning approaches have been analyzed, however, there is no clear evidence about the superiority of any of the approach. Conclusions: The management of BD could be significantly improved by monitoring of illness activity via smartphone.","Smartphone-based monitoring has clear potential for facilitating timely and contextual care delivery for patients with bipolar disorder.

277,,A new supervised retinal vessel segmentation method based on robust hybrid features,"Retinal blood vessels , Segmentation , Hybrid feature vector , Random forest.","In this paper, we propose a new supervised retinal blood vessel segmentation method that combines a set of very robust features from different algorithms into a hybrid feature vector for pixel characterization. This 17-D feature vector consists of 13 Gabor filter responses computed at different configurations, contrast enhanced intensity, morphological top-hat transformed intensity, vessel-ness measure, and BCOSFIRE filter response. A random forest classifier, known for its speed, simplicity, and information fusion capability, is trained with the hybrid feature vector. The chosen combination of the different types of individually strong features results in increased local information with better discrimination for vessel and non-vessel pixels in both healthy and pathological retinal images. The proposed method is evaluated in detail on two publicly available databases DRIVE and STARE. Average classification accuracies of 0.9513 and 0.9605 on the DRIVE and STARE datasets, respectively, are achieved. When the majority of the common performance metrics are considered, our method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods. Performance results show that our method also outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both cross training and pathological cases.","In this paper, we have proposed an effective method for the segmentation of the retinal blood vessels by pixel classification based on supervised learning. We have constructed a 17-D feature vector including contrast enhanced intensity, vessel-ness measure, intensity of morphologically transformed image, multi-scale response of Gabor wavelet and also B-COSFIRE filter response which has been used for the first time in a multi-feature supervised segmentation method. We have selected RF classifier which has shown ability for fusing the information from diverse features for labeling each pixel as a vessel or non-vessel pixel. The classifier has been trained by selecting 300,000 samples randomly from the DRIVE dataset and 60,000 samples from the STARE dataset. Despite that number of samples used by the proposed method for training on the STARE dataset is less than other multi-feature supervised methods, such as Soares et al. [24], Cheng et al. [4] and Fraz et al. [25] with 1 million, 200,000 and 75,000 samples, respectively, the average value of accuracy (0.9605) and area under ROC curve (0.9789) for our method are higher than all of the state-of-the-art methods. The performance evaluation results shows that the varied types of features selected for the method act complementary and the constructed hybrid feature vector boosts the accuracy and reliability of vessel segmentation. With regard to the cross training results, the proposed method achieves the highest value of average accuracy in both the DRIVE (0.9496) and STARE (0.9545) datasets compared to the other methods. These results shows that the proposed method is fairly robust to training set used, and still achieves the best accuracy while most of the other methods suffer from substantial accuracy decreases in cross training case. The property of training data independency of our method allows for its application on assorted datasets without the need for retraining, and this is definitely advantageous for wide screening programs. The performance of the proposed method on the pathological images is better than other methods. The average value of accuracy of the proposed method for 10 abnormal images from the STARE dataset is 0.9573 which is the highest value reported for images in this category. Thus,the robustness of our method against abnormal images is also verified.",Medical Data Analysis,"The paper proposes a new method for retinal blood vessel segmentation based on supervised learning.

278,,Skull fracture prediction through subject-specific finite element modelling is highly sensitive to model parameters,Finite element modelling Head injury Impact biomechanics Skull fracture,"Reliable computer models are needed for a better understanding of the physical mechanisms of skull fracture in accidental hits, falls, bicycle - motor vehicle & car accidents and assaults. The performance and biofidelity of these models depend on the correct anatomical representation and material description of these structures. In literature, a strain energy criterion has been proposed to predict skull fractures. However, a broad range of values for this criterion has been reported. This study investigates if the impactor orientation, scalp thickness and material model of the skull could provide us with insight in the influencing factors of this criterion. 18 skull fracture experiments previously performed in our research group were reproduced in finite element simulations. Subject-specific skull geometries were derived from medical images and used to create high-quality finite element meshes. Based on local Hounsfield units, a subject-specific isotropic material model was assigned. The subject-specific models were able to predict fractures who matched visually with the corresponding experimental fracture patterns and provided detailed fracture patterns. The sensitivity study showed that small variations in impactor positioning as well as variations of the local geometry (frontal-temporal-occipital) strongly influenced the skull strain energy. Subject-specific modelling leads to a more accurate prediction of the force-displacement curve. The average error of the peak fracture force for all the 18 cases is 0.4190 for the subject-specific and 0.4538 for the homogeneous material model, for the displacement; 0.3368 versus 0.3844. But it should be carefully interpreted as small variations in the computational model significantly influence the outcome.","This study investigated the validity of an energy based skull fracture criterion with subject-specific FE head models. 18 different experimental impacts were reconstructed and each impact was simulated with a homogeneous material model as well as a subject-specific model based on local bone densities. The models using the subject-specific material model predicted the moment of fracture with a higher accuracy than the homogeneous material model. Furthermore, these models have the ability to predict the fracture lines with, to the authors knowledge, unprecedented precision. However, the modelling of the post-fracture behaviour is currently not satisfactory and should be improved upon. The findings in this study identified influencing factors on the skull strain energy such as contact area, scalp thickness and impactor positioning. The energy criterion is unable to take into account the effect of differences in geometry and bone properties. These results strongly invalidate the existence of an energy-based fracture criterion. We concluded that subject-specific modelling leads to a more accurate prediction of the force-displacement curve but it should be carefully interpreted as small variations in the computational model significantly influences the results.",Medical Data Analysis,"This study aims to investigate the validity of an energy-based skull fracture criterion using subject-specific finite element head models. 18 different experimental impacts were reconstructed, and each impact was simulated using a homogeneous material model and a subject-specific model based on local bone densities.

279,,Comparison of modern and conventional imaging techniques in establishing multiple myeloma-related bone disease: a systematic review,"multiple myeloma, bone disease, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography - computerized tomography, X-ray.","This systematic review of studies compared magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), FDG-PET with computerized tomography (PET-CT) and CT with whole body X-Ray (WBXR) or (whole body) CT in order to provide evidence based diagnostic guidelines in multiple myeloma bone disease. A comprehensive search of 3 bibliographic databases was performed; methodological quality was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) criteria (score 1–14). Data from 32 directly comparative studies were extracted. The mean QUADAS score was 7.1 (3–11), with quality hampered mainly by a poor description of selection and execution criteria. All index tests had a higher detection rate when compared to WBXR, with up to 80% more lesions detected by the newer imaging techniques; MRI (1.12–1.82) CT (1.04–1.33), PET (1.00–1.58) and PET-CT (1.27–1.45). However, the modern imaging techniques detected fewer lesions in the skull and ribs. In a direct comparison CT and MRI performed equally with respect to detection rate and sensitivity. This systematic review supports the International Myeloma Working Group guidelines, which recommend that WBCT can replace WBXR. In our opinion, the equal performance of MRI also indicates that it is a valuable alternative. As lesions of the skull and ribs are underdiagnosed by modern imaging techniques we advise additional X-rays of these regions. The consequences of this approach are discussed.","In conclusion, this systematic review showed that MRI, CT and FDG-PET(-CT) are sensitive techniques with a higher detection rate of MM-related bone disease in comparison with WBXR, with the exception of the skull and ribs. We therefore recommend additional X-ray of the ribs (chest X-ray) and the skull in cases where no bone lesions are detected with the newer imaging techniques, as omitting XR of the ribs and the skull in these cases could lead to the underdiagnosis of MM-related bone disease. A solid statement regarding the superiority of one of the newer imaging techniques to detect MM bone disease at diagnosis or relapse cannot be given based on our systematic review. However, given the equal diagnostic value of MRI and CT as compared to WBXR, we are of the opinion that MRI should be incorporated as an equal alternative for CT. MRI might be the preferred investigation at diagnosis because of its repeatedly reported prognostic value, which appeared not to hold true for CT. FDG-PET-CT is a promising alternative, especially during follow-up, as it depicts active lesions and normalization of FDG-uptake during treatment has been found to predict outcome. Future studies, focussing on prognostic value as well as the role of imaging in follow-up, will determine which technique, or combination of techniques should be the new gold standard.",Medical Data Analysis,"This systematic review compared different imaging techniques for the diagnosis of multiple myeloma bone disease, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), FDG-PET with computerized tomography (PET-CT), and whole body X-Ray (WBXR) or (whole body) CT.

280,,"Bone Loss, Weight Loss, and Weight Fluctuation Predict Mortality Risk in Elderly Men and Women","Bone loss, BMD, weight loss, weight fluctuation, mortality, fracture.","Introduction: Although low BMD has been shown to be associated with mortality in women, the effect of BMD is affected by weight and weight change and the contribution of these factors to mortality risk, particularly in men, is not known. This study examined the association between baseline BMD, rate of bone loss, weight loss, and weight fluctuation and all-cause mortality risk in elderly men and women. Materials and Methods: Data from 1059 women and 644 men, >=60 years of age (as of 1989), of white background who participated in the Dubbo Osteoporosis Epidemiology Study were analyzed. All-cause mortality was recorded annually between 1989 and 2004. BMD at the femoral neck was measured by DXA (GE-LUNAR) at baseline and at approximately every 2 yr afterward. Data on incident osteoporotic fractures and concomitant diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, all types of cancer, and type I/II diabetes mellitus, was also recorded. Results: In the multivariable Cox’s proportional hazards model with adjustment for age, incident fractures, and concomitant diseases, the following variables were independent risk factors of all-cause mortality in men: rate of BMD loss of at least 1%/yr, rate of weight loss of at least 1%/yr, and weight fluctuation (defined by the CV) of at least 3%. In women, in addition to the significant factors observed in men, lower baseline BMD was also an independent risk factor of mortality. In both sexes, baseline weight was not an independent and significant predictor of mortality risk. Approximately 36% and 22% of deaths in women and men, respectively, were attributable to the four risk factors. Conclusions: These data suggest that, although low BMD was a risk factor of mortality in women, it was not a risk factor of mortality in men. However, high rates of BMD loss, weight loss, and weight fluctuation were also independent predictors of all-cause mortality in elderly men and women, independent of age, incident fracture, and concomitant diseases.","In conclusion, these data suggest that lower BMD was an independent predictor of mortality in women but not in men. Furthermore, in addition to low baseline BMD, rate of BMD loss and weight fluctuation were also significant predictors of all-cause mortality in elderly men and women, independent from age and concomitant diseases. Although the risk factors found to be associated with mortality in this study probably reflect the underlying frailty or the presence of other wasting diseases in the elderly, these findings partly re-emphasize the public health burden of osteoporosis in the general population.

281,,Bone Disease in Thalassemia: A Frequent and Still Unresolved Problem,"DXA, BMD, fractures, vertebral morphometry, thalassemia.","Adults with b thalassemia major frequently have low BMD, fractures, and bone pain. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of low BMD, fractures, and bone pain in all thalassemia syndromes in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, associations of BMD with fractures and bone pain, and etiology of bone disease in thalassemia. Patients of all thalassemia syndromes in the Thalassemia Clinical Research Network, $6 yr of age, with no preexisting medical condition affecting bone mass or requiring steroids, participated. We measured spine and femur BMD and whole body BMC by DXA and assessed vertebral abnormalities by morphometric X-ray absorptiometry (MXA). Medical history by interview and review of medical records, physical examinations, and blood and urine collections were performed. Three hundred sixty-one subjects, 49% male, with a mean age of 23.2 yr (range, 6.1–75 yr), were studied. Spine and femur BMD Z-scores < 22 occurred in 46% and 25% of participants, respectively. Greater age, lower weight, hypogonadism, and increased bone turnover were strong independent predictors of low bone mass regardless of thalassemia syndrome. Peak bone mass was suboptimal. Thirty-six percent of patients had a history of fractures, and 34% reported bone pain. BMD was negatively associated with fractures but not with bone pain. Nine percent of participants had uniformly decreased height of several vertebrae by MXA, which was associated with the use of iron chelator deferoxamine before 6 yr of age. In patients with thalassemia, low BMD and fractures occur frequently and independently of the particular syndrome. Peak bone mass is suboptimal. Low BMD is associated with hypogonadism, increased bone turnover, and an increased risk for fractures.","In summary, in this large cohort of patients across all thalassemia syndromes, we observed a high prevalence of fractures and a strong association between bone mass and fractures. Therefore, strategies to improve BMD are very important in thalassemia management. We showed that bone disease in thalassemia is an adolescent problem with adult manifestations. Current transfusion and chelation practices seem insufficient to prevent the development of low bone mass. Our data highlight the need for randomized trials to determine the appropriate form of gonadal steroid replacement and vitamin D supplementation as well as additional strategies to optimize bone accrual in this disease. Further longitudinal studies are needed to address changes of bone mass during puberty. Finally, changes in bone turn over seem to be involved in the development of bone disease, although the factors that lead to increased bone resorption in thalassemia remain unclear and warrant further study.",Medical Data Analysis,"This study aimed to determine the prevalence of low bone mineral density (BMD), fractures, and bone pain in patients with thalassemia across childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, as well as the etiology of bone disease in thalassemia.

282,,Relationship Between Low Bone Mineral Density and Fractures With Incident Cardiovascular Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,OSTEOPOROSIS; BONE MINERAL DENSITY; CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE; META-ANALYSIS,"An increasing evidence base suggests that low bone mineral density (BMD) and fractures are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis summarizing the evidence of low BMD and fractures as risk factors for future CVD. Two independent authors searched major databases from inception to August 1, 2016, for longitudinal studies reporting data on CVD incidence (overall and specific CVD) and BMD status and fractures. The association between low BMD, fractures, and CVD across longitudinal studies was explored by calculating pooled adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with a random-effects meta-analysis. Twenty-eight studies (18 regarding BMD and 10 fractures) followed a total of 1,107,885 participants for a median of 5 years. Taking those with higher BMD as the reference, people with low BMD were at increased risk of developing CVD during follow-up (11 studies; HR ¼ 1.33; 95%CI, 1.27 to 1.38; I 2 ¼ 53%), after adjusting for a median of eight confounders. This finding was confirmed using a decrease in one standard deviation of baseline BMD (9 studies; HR ¼ 1.16; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.24; I 2¼ 69%). The presence of fractures at baseline was associated with an increased risk of developing CVD (HR ¼ 1.20; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.37; I 2¼ 91%). Regarding specific CVDs, low BMD was associated with an increased risk of developing coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular conditions, and CVD-associated death. Fractures at baseline was associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular conditions and death due to CVD. In conclusion, low BMD and fractures are associated with a small, but significant increased risk of CVD risk and possibly death.","In conclusion, low BMD and fractures appear to be associated with a higher risk (albeit of small-modest effect size) of future CVD. Although the data suggests a relationship, one should note there were some sources of potential bias in the literature. Nonetheless, because CVD events could accelerate the transition of people with bone diseases to greater disability and mortality, our meta-analysis suggests it may be important to consider the cardiovascular health of people with osteoporosis and fractures. Future studies are required to evaluate if addressing low BMD and fractures could positively influence CV outcomes. Such studies should ensure matching between cases and controls and attempt to disentangle underlying pathophysiological and behavioral (eg, physical activity, nutrition) mechanisms, which could potentially be targets for future preventative interventions.",Medical Data Analysis,"This systematic review and meta-analysis found that low bone mineral density (BMD) and fractures are associated with a small but significant increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and possibly death.

People with low BMD were at increased risk of developing overall CVD, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular conditions, and CVD-associated death. The presence of fractures at baseline was associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular conditions and death due to CVD.

283,,"Melatonin effects on bone: potential use for the prevention and treatment for osteopenia, osteoporosis, and periodontal disease and for use in bone-grafting procedures","melatonin, menopause, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteopenia, osteoporosis, Per2","An important role for melatonin in bone formation and restructuring has emerged, and studies demonstrate the multiple mechanisms for these beneficial actions. Statistical analysis shows that even with existing osteoporotic therapies, bone-related disease, and mortality are on the rise, creating a huge financial burden for societies worldwide. These findings suggest that novel alternatives need to be developed to either prevent or reverse bone loss to combat osteoporosis-related fractures. The focus of this review describes melatonin’s role in bone physiology and discusses how disruption of melatonin rhythms by light exposure at night, shift work, and disease can adversely impact on bone. The signal transduction mechanisms underlying osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and coupling with one another are discussed with a focus on how melatonin, through the regulation of RANKL and osteoprotegerin synthesis and release from osteoblasts, can induce osteoblastogenesis while inhibiting osteoclastogenesis. Also, melatonin’s free-radical scavenging and antioxidant properties of this indoleamine are discussed as yet an additional mechanism by which melatonin can maintain one’s bone health, especially oral health. The clinical use for melatonin in bone-grafting procedures, in reversing bone loss due to osteopenia and osteoporosis, and in managing periodontal disease is discussed.","Additional multicentered, randomized control trials (RCTs) in heterogeneous and susceptible populations (e.g., peri- or postmenopausal women, and elderly men and women) are required to assess the efficacy of melatonin to prevent and/or treat bone loss as described [38]. Presently, there are two ongoing RCTs registered with clinicaltrials.gov – one that assesses melatonin alone on treating osteopenia entitled ‘Treatment of Osteopenia With Melatonin (MelaOst)’ (clinical trial identifier: NCT01690000) and the other assessing melatonin in combination with other micronutrients to treat osteopenia entitled ‘Melatonin-Micronutrients for Osteopenia Treatment Study (MOTS)’ (clinical trial identifier: NCT01870115). Attention needs to be given to both the timing and dosing of melatonin as very high doses of melatonin (i.e., 50 mg/kg body weight) may reduce bone remodeling, thus substantially preventing fracture healing as shown in mice [118]. Also, the effect of melatonin on the ratio of osteoblast to osteoclast activity should be analyzed as osteoblasts and osteoclasts are tightly coupled (Figs 2 and 3), and melatonin affects both the osteoblast and osteoclast. As mentioned in the review by Amstrup et al. [38] and described in the first RCT conducted, the MOPS [26], women taking melatonin nightly for 6 months demonstrated no significant changes in their overall osteoclast or osteoblast activity when compared to each of their baseline values, respectively; however, a time-dependent decrease in the ratio of their osteoclast to osteoblast activity did occur, which was not observed in women taking placebo. These findings reinforce the important fact that in order for appropriate or normal bone remodeling to occur, both osteoclasts and osteoblasts need to be in equilibrium. It would be interesting to determine whether this melatonin-induced restoration of balance between bone-resorbing osteoclasts and bone-forming osteoblasts observed in the MOPS trial, if given over long periods (>2 yr), would decrease rates of osteopenia, osteoporosis, and bone fracture. These studies and more are warranted and should be pursued.",Medical Data Analysis,"This review article discusses the emerging role of melatonin in bone physiology and its potential as a therapeutic option for preventing or treating bone loss, particularly in conditions such as osteopenia and osteoporosis.

Methods: In this study, extensive research efforts were made to identify those studies that applied more than one supervised machine learning algorithm on single disease prediction. Two databases (i.e., Scopus and PubMed) were searched for different types of search items. Thus, we selected 48 articles in total for the comparison among variants supervised machine learning algorithms for disease prediction. Results: We found that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is applied most frequently (in 29 studies) followed by the Naïve Bayes algorithm (in 23 studies). However, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm showed superior accuracy comparatively. Of the 17 studies where it was applied, RF showed the highest accuracy in 9 of them, i.e., 53%. This was followed by SVM which topped in 41% of the studies it was considered. Conclusion: This study provides a wide overview of the relative performance of different variants of supervised machine learning algorithms for disease prediction. This important information of relative performance can be used to aid researchers in the selection of an appropriate supervised machine learning algorithm for their studies.","This research attempted to study comparative performances of different supervised machine learning algorithms in disease prediction. Since clinical data and research scope varies widely between disease prediction studies, a comparison was only possible when a common benchmark on the dataset and scope is established. Therefore, we only chose studies that implemented multiple machine learning methods on the same data and disease prediction for comparison. Regardless of the variations on frequency and performances, the results show the potential of these families of algorithms in the disease prediction.",Deep Learning and Machine Learning,"This study aimed to compare the performance and usage of different types of supervised machine learning algorithms for disease risk prediction.

285,,Deep gluteal syndrome is defned as a non‑discogenic sciatic nerve disorder with entrapment in the deep gluteal space: a systematic review,"Hip , Deep gluteal syndrome , Disease defnition , Diagnostic pathway , Systematic review.","Purpose Clinicians are not confident in diagnosing deep gluteal syndrome (DGS) because of the ambiguity of the DGS disease definition and DGS diagnostic pathway. The purpose of this systematic review was to identify the DGS disease definition, and also to define a general DGS diagnostic pathway. Methods A systematic search was performed using four electronic databases: PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. In eligibility criteria, studies in which cases were explicitly diagnosed with DGS were included, whereas review articles and commentary papers were excluded. Data are presented descriptively. Results The initial literature search yielded 359 articles, of which 14 studies met the eligibility criteria, pooling 853 patients with clinically diagnosed with DGS. In this review, it was discovered that the DGS disease definition was composed of three parts: (1) non-discogenic, (2) sciatic nerve disorder, and (3) nerve entrapment in the deep gluteal space. In the diagnosis of DGS, we found five diagnostic procedures: (1) history taking, (2) physical examination, (3) imaging tests, (4) response-to-injection, and (5) nerve-specific tests (electromyography). History taking (e.g. posterior hip pain, radicular pain, and difficulty sitting for 30 min), physical examination (e.g. tenderness in deep gluteal space, pertinent positive results with seated piriformis test, and positive Pace sign), and imaging tests (e.g. pelvic radiographs, spine and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) were generally performed in cases clinically diagnosed with DGS. Conclusion Existing literature suggests the DGS disease definition as being a non-discogenic sciatic nerve disorder with entrapment in the deep gluteal space. Also, the general diagnostic pathway for DGS was composed of history taking (posterior hip pain, radicular pain, and difficulty sitting for 30 min), physical examination (tenderness in deep gluteal space, positive seated piriformis test, and positive Pace sign), and imaging tests (pelvic radiographs, pelvic MRI, and spine MRI). This review helps clinicians diagnose DGS with more confidence.","The DGS disease defnition was identifed as being a non-discogenic sciatic nerve disorder with entrapment in the deep gluteal space. Also, we proposed the general diagnostic pathway for DGS using history taking (posterior hip pain, radicular pain, and difficulty sitting for more than 30 min), physical examination (tenderness in deep gluteal space, pertinent positive results with seated piriformis test, and positive Pace sign), and imaging tests (pelvic radiographs, pelvic MRI, and spine MRI).",Medical Data Analysis,"This systematic review aimed to identify the disease definition and diagnostic pathway for deep gluteal syndrome (DGS), a condition that clinicians may struggle to diagnose due to its ambiguous definition and diagnostic pathway.

The review identified the DGS disease definition as a non-discogenic sciatic nerve disorder with entrapment in the deep gluteal space, and proposed a general diagnostic pathway using history taking, physical examination, and imaging tests. The history taking should include posterior hip pain, radicular pain, and difficulty sitting for more than 30 minutes, while the physical examination should involve tenderness in the deep gluteal space, pertinent positive results with the seated piriformis test, and positive Pace sign.

Approximately 1/6th of the world’s population suffers from these disorders, yet there are no definitive solutions to cure these diseases after the symptoms set in. The best way to treat these disorders is to detect them at an earlier stage. Many of these diseases are genetic; this enables machine learning algorithms to give inferences based on the patient’s medical records and history. Machine learning algorithms such as deep neural networks are also critical for the early identification of degenerative nerve diseases. The significant applications of machine learning and deep learning in early diagnosis and establishing potential therapies for degenerative nerve diseases have motivated us to work on this review paper. Through this review, we covered various machine learning and deep learning algorithms and their application in the diagnosis of degenerative nerve diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Furthermore, we also included the recent advancements in each of these models, which improved their capabilities for classifying degenerative nerve diseases. The limitations of each of these methods are also discussed. In the conclusion, we mention open research challenges and various alternative technologies, such as virtual reality and Big data analytics, which can be useful for the diagnosis of degenerative nerve diseases.","Degenerative nerve diseases have been a popular topic of interest for a very long time. These disorders are untreatable and worsen the patient’s condition with time. The only measure we can currently take is to slow down the progression of these diseases. The early diagnosis of these diseases can enable patients to practice preventive measures before the disease progresses to an uncontrollable stage; hence, the early diagnosis and progression tracking of these disorders are crucial. Through this paper, we assessed the role of machine learning and deep learning in the diagnosis of these disorders and identified various algorithms that have shown promising results when used for the diagnosis of degenerative nerve diseases. Recent developments in each of these algorithms, such as the use of a hybrid clustering and DBN to improve the scalability and accuracy of classification of patients with Parkinson’s disease or a combination of sliding window approach and k-means clustering and dynamic network analyses for diagnosing dementia patients, show the immense potential that the various ML and DL algorithms have in the early diagnosis and tracking of these diseases. In the models we surveyed, we found that artificial neural networks and deep neural networks, including deep CNNs and deep belief networks, are the most promising algorithms for detecting degenerative nerve diseases. However, we found out that the use of ML and DL is still plagued by major challenges such as a lack of available data and lower scalability and accuracy. Hence, the future direction of research on using ML and DL to diagnose degenerative nerve diseases should be to overcome these challenges.

287,,Gut Microbiota Are Related to Parkinson’s Disease and Clinical Phenotype,microbiome; gastrointestinal dysfunction; biomarker; gut-brain-axis; non-motor symptoms.,"In the course of Parkinson’s disease (PD), the enteric nervous system (ENS) and parasympathetic nerves are amongst the structures earliest and most frequently affected by alpha-synuclein pathology. Accordingly, gastrointestinal dysfunction, in particular constipation, is an important non-motor symptom in PD and often precedes the onset of motor symptoms by years. Recent research has shown that intestinal microbiota interact with the autonomic and central nervous system via diverse pathways including the ENS and vagal nerve. The gut microbiome in PD has not been previously investigated. We compared the fecal microbiomes of 72 PD patients and 72 control subjects by pyrosequencing the V1–V3 regions of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Associations between clinical parameters and microbiota were analyzed using generalized linear models, taking into account potential confounders. On average, the abundance of Prevotellaceae in feces of PD patients was reduced by 77.6% as compared with controls. Relative abundance of Prevotellaceae of 6.5% or less had 86.1% sensitivity and 38.9% specificity for PD. A logistic regression classifier based on the abundance of four bacterial families and the severity of constipation identified PD patients with 66.7% sensitivity and 90.3% specificity. The relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae was positively associated with the severity of postural instability and gait difficulty. These findings suggest that the intestinal microbiome is altered in PD and is related to motor phenotype. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the temporal and causal relationships between gut microbiota and PD and the suitability of the microbiome as a biomarker.","Our findings shed new light on previous reports regarding gastrointestinal involvement in PD. Investigating whether high abundance of Prevotellaceae has protective effects against PD or whether low abundance is rather an indicator of disturbed mucosal barrier function will be important. Although very sensitive, low Prevotellaceae levels alone are not specific for PD. Inclusion of other bacterial families may increase accuracy, and further exploring the potential of fecal microbiome analysis as a biomarker for PD seems worthwhile. Further studies may elucidate the temporal and causal relationships between gut microbiota and PD and the mechanisms involved.",Medical Data Analysis,This study investigated the fecal microbiomes of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and control subjects and found that the abundance of Prevotellaceae was reduced in PD patients by 77.6% on average.

We aimed to specify ultrasonographic findings in patients with PIN syndrome in comparison to healthy volunteers. Methods: Ultrasound images and clinical data of 13 patients with PIN syndrome confirmed by neurological examination and electrophysiological testing were evaluated retrospectively. Anteroposterior nerve diameters measured at the arcade of Frohse were compared with those of 20 healthy volunteers. The echotexture and the presence of a caliber change of the PIN were additionally assessed. Results: Enlargement of the PIN was seen in all patients with PIN syndrome, but not in volunteers (statistically significant difference in mean diameter P < 0.05). Furthermore, edema and caliber change of the PIN were present in all patients. Conclusions: High-resolution ultrasound allows for differentiation between patients with PIN syndrome and healthy volunteers.","HRUS is an essential tool in the work-up of a patient with PIN syndrome. As the clinical and electrodiagnostic presentation of a PIN syndrome is straightforward, sonography is definitely not needed to define the syndrome itself, although it can confirm the syndrome in doubtful cases by demonstrating the typical findings of nerve compression, including fascicular loss due to edema, impaired echogenic texture, and caliber change.

One critical step for facial expression recognition (FER) is to accurately extract emotional features. Current approaches on FER in static images have not fully considered and utilized the features of facial element and muscle movements, which represent static and dynamic, as well as geometric and appearance characteristics of facial expressions. This paper proposes an approach to solve this limitation using ""salient” distance features, which are obtained by extracting patch-based 3D Gabor features, selecting the ""salient” patches, and performing patch matching operations. The experimental results demonstrate high correct recognition rate (CRR), significant performance improvements due to the consideration of facial element and muscle movements, promising results under face registration errors, and fast processing time. Comparison with the state-of-the-art performance confirms that the proposed approach achieves the highest CRR on the JAFFE database and is among the top performers on the Cohn-Kanade (CK) database.","This paper explores the issue of facial expression recognition using facial movement features. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is testified by the recognition performance, computational time, and comparison with the state-of-the-art performance. The experimental results also demonstrate significant performance improvements due to the consideration of facial movement features and promising performance under face registration errors.

The results indicate that patch-based Gabor features show a better performance over point-based Gabor features in terms of extracting regional features, keeping the position information, achieving a better recognition performance, and requiring a less number. Different emotions have different “salient” areas; however, the majority of these areas are distributed around mouth and eyes. In addition, these “salient” areas for each emotion seem to not be influenced by the choice of using point-based or using patch-based features. The “salient” patches are distributed across all scales with an emphasis on the higher scales. For both the JAFFE and CK databases, DL2 performs the best among four distances. As for emotion, anger contributes most to the misrecognition. The JAFFE database requires larger sizes of patches than the CK database to keep useful information.

The proposed approach can be potentially applied into many applications, such as patient state detection, driver fatigue monitoring, and intelligent tutoring system. In our future work, we will extend our approach to a video-based FER system by combining patch-based Gabor features with motion information in multiframes.

Benefit from the recent success of deep learning techniques, especially the invention of convolution neural networks (CNN), various end-to-end deep learning-based FER systems have been proposed in the past few years. However, overfitting caused by a lack of training data is still the big challenge that almost all deep FER systems have to put into a concern to achieve high-performance accuracy. In this paper, we are going to build a FER model to recognize eight commons emotions: neutral, happiness, sadness, surprise, fear, disgust, anger, and contempt on the AffectNet dataset. In order to mitigate the effect of small training data, which is prone to overfitting, we proposed a thoughtful transfer learning framework. Specifically, we fine-tuning ResNet-50 model, which is pre-trained on ImageNet dataset for object detection task, on the AffectNet dataset to recognize eight above mentioned face emotions. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed FER model.","Over the past several years, deep CNN has significantly boosted the performance of many systems in visual classification field.

In this paper, we proposed a deep transfer learning framework to mitigate the overfitting problem, which improves the discriminative power of our FER model. Nonetheless, the recognition accuracy is still not meet our expectation. This may be caused by the high imbalance of AffectNet data where the number of sample of major classes (e.g., Happy and Sad) are much larger than that of minor classes (e.g., Contempt and Disgust). Using different models and training processes as well as apply recently successful loss functions to further boost the performance is still in our future work.

299,,Emotion recognition of static and dynamic faces in autism spectrum disorder,AutismAsperger's disorderFacial emotion recognitionDynamic faces,"There is substantial evidence for facial emotion recognition (FER) deficits in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The extent of this impairment, however, remains unclear, and there is some suggestion that clinical groups might benefit from the use of dynamic rather than static images. High-functioning individuals with ASD (n = 36) and typically developing controls (n = 36) completed a computerised FER task involving static and dynamic expressions of the six basic emotions. The ASD group showed poorer overall performance in identifying anger and disgust and were disadvantaged by dynamic (relative to static) stimuli when presented with sad expressions. Among both groups, however, dynamic stimuli appeared to improve recognition of anger. This research provides further evidence of specific impairment in the recognition of negative emotions in ASD, but argues against any broad advantages associated with the use of dynamic displays.","Individuals with ASD were impaired in the recognition of facial expressions showing anger and disgust. Although there were no overall group differences for the recognition of sad facial expressions, people with ASD were disadvantaged by the presentation of dynamic (compared with static) images of sad facial expressions. Lastly, although there were group differences for recognition of expressions of anger (with the ASD group performing worse), here there was an overall advantage for both groups when recognising dynamic images showing facial expressions of anger.

Impaired recognition of anger and disgust in ASD is somewhat consistent with studies involving similar patient groups (i.e., high-functioning ASD), where deficits have been found in the recognition of basic negative emotions such as fear, disgust, anger and sadness (Harms et al., Citation2010). These data further highlight that FER impairments in ASD do not extend to all emotions, but rather seem to be limited to negative emotions. From a clinical perspective, a failure to accurately recognise negative emotions in others may be substantially more disadvantageous than a failure to recognise positive emotions, and lead to greater interpersonal difficulties across a range of settings. For instance, a failure to recognise anger or disgust in another person, and a consequent failure to adjust behaviour accordingly, might exacerbate interpersonal difficulties or produce conflict across a range of settings. By contrast, if there was a failure to accurately recognise, for example, happiness, this would be unlikely to produce a similarly negative outcome. Interestingly, and despite the observed differences, there did not appear to be any differences in the pattern of errors for specific emotional expressions between the groups. There were no group differences for happy or surprise; while happy expressions were associated with a ceiling effect, that we did not detect a difference for surprise seems consistent with recent research. For instance, Law Smith et al. (Citation2010) reported deficits in recognising surprise in ASD but only at low intensities. The surprise stimuli used in the present study may have lacked the necessary subtlety to detect impairment in ASD.

While we were primarily interested in the influence of dynamic images, it appears that the use of dynamic facial expressions had relatively little effect. It is often suggested that dynamic stimuli have greater ecological validity and should be more easily recognised than static images, and this was the case, for all participants, for anger. Somewhat paradoxically, however, the presentation of dynamic images for the sad facial expression resulted in a reduction in accuracy (relative to static) among individuals with ASD (although overall group differences were not significant), suggesting that in some instances individuals with ASD might actually be disadvantaged by dynamic (relative to static) facial expressions. It is not immediately clear why individuals with ASD would be disadvantaged by a dynamic presentation for just one emotion. Neuroimaging research suggests that brain networks that process static and dynamic faces do differ somewhat (Kilts et al., Citation2003), and these different networks (or functions underlying these networks) could be differentially affected in ASD (at least in relation to the recognition of sadness). For example, structures thought to comprise the mirror neuron system, which is seemingly responsive to goal-directed and dynamic expressions of behaviour, have been shown as underactive in ASD (Dapretto et al., Citation2006). Recent research also implicates poor neural connectivity in ASD, particularly to and within prefrontal and parietal regions (Just, Cherkassky, Keller, Kana, & Minshew, Citation2007; Wicker et al., Citation2008). In this respect, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of people with ASD using the current stimuli will be of great interest, as will similar studies with alternate stimulus sets. Lastly, it is possible that the duration of the dynamic images was too brief to benefit individuals with ASD (Gepner & Feron, Citation2009), although the extent to which this would apply to “high-functioning” individuals is not clear.
",Deep Learning and Machine Learning,"The study investigated the facial emotion recognition (FER) deficits in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to typically developing individuals using static and dynamic expressions of the six basic emotions. The results showed that individuals with ASD were impaired in recognizing facial expressions of anger and disgust, and dynamic stimuli did not provide a significant advantage. Moreover, the study highlighted that FER impairments in ASD are limited to negative emotions and that the failure to recognize negative emotions in others may lead to greater interpersonal difficulties.

300,,Two-level attention with two-stage multi-task learning for facial emotion recognition,Facial emotion recognitionAttention mechanismMulti-task learningValence-arousal dimension,"Compared with facial emotion estimation on categorical model, dimensional emotion estimation can describe numerous emotions more accurately. Most prior works of dimensional emotion estimation only considered laboratory data and used video, speech or other multi-modal features. Compared with other modal data, static images has superiorities of accessibility, which is more conducive to the emotion estimation in real world. In this paper, a two-level attention with two-stage multi-task learning (2Att-2Mt) framework is proposed for facial emotion estimation on only static images. Firstly, the features of corresponding region (position level features) are extracted and enhanced automatically by first-level attention mechanism. Then, we utilize Bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network (Bi-RNN) with self-attention (second-level attention) to make full use of the relationship features of different layers (layer-level features) adaptively. And then, we propose a two-stage multi-task learning structure, which exploits categorical representations to ameliorate the dimensional representations and estimate valence and arousal simultaneously in view of the inherent complexity of dimensional representations and correlation of the two targets. The quantitative results conducted on AffectNet dataset show significant advancement on Concordance Correlation Coefficient(CCC) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), illustrating the superiority of the proposed framework. Besides, extensive comparative experiments have also fully demonstrated the effectiveness of different components (2Att and 2Mt) in our framework.","This paper proposes a new framework, called 2Att-2Mt, for accurately estimating emotions from static images.

full-face images. However, when images are collected in naturalistic settings (e.g., using smartphone’s frontal camera), these
images are likely to be far from ideal due to camera positioning, lighting conditions, and camera shake. The impact these
conditions have on the accuracy of commercial emotion recognition services has not been studied in full detail. To fill this
gap, we selected five prominent commercial emotion recognition systems—Amazon Rekognition, Baidu Research, Face++,

systems’ accuracy at classifying images drawn from three standardized facial expression databases. In Experiment 2, we first
identified several common scenarios (e.g., partially visible face) that can lead to poor-quality pictures during smartphone
use, and manipulated the same set of images used in Experiment 1 to simulate these scenarios. We used the manipulated

305,,"Facial expression megamix: Tests of dimensional and
category accounts of emotion recognition",,"We report four experiments investigating the perception of photographic quality continua
of interpolated (‘morphed’) facial expressions derived from prototypes of the 6 emotions in
the Ekman and Friesen (1976) series (happiness, surprise, fear, sadness, disgust and anger).
In Experiment 1, morphed images made from all possible pairwise combinations of
expressions were presented in random order; subjects identified these as belonging to
distinct expression categories corresponding to the prototypes at each end of the relevant
continuum. This result was replicated in Experiment 2, which also included morphs made
from a prototype with a neutral expression, and allowed ‘neutral’ as a response category.
These findings are inconsistent with the view that facial expressions are recognised by
locating them along two underlying dimensions, since such a view predicts that at least
some transitions between categories should involve neutral regions or identification as a
different emotion. Instead, they suggest that facial expressions of basic emotions are
recognised by their fit to discrete categories. Experiment 3 used continua involving 6
emotions to demonstrate best discrimination of pairs of stimuli falling across category
boundaries; this provides further evidence of categorical perception of facial expressions of
emotion. However, in both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, reaction time data showed that
increasing distance from the prototype had a definite cost on ability to identify emotion in
the resulting morphed face. Moreover, Experiment 4 showed that subjects had some insight
into which emotions were blended to create specific morphed images. Hence, categorical
perception effects were found even though subjects were sensitive to physical properties of
these morphed facial expressions. We suggest that rapid classification of prototypes and
better across boundary discriminability reflect the underlying organisation of human
categorisation abilities.","The results of Experiment 4 show that when a prototype only contributes 10%
to a particular morph, subjects cannot reliably identify which prototype that 10%
has come from, but that for prototypes contributing 30% they begin to be able to
do this. This is interesting because in Experiment 1 all 30% morphs were
consistently identified as belonging to the category contributing 70%. However,
we noted that distance from the prototype affected reaction times for classifying
morphed expressions in Experiment 1, which implied that people can see
differences between these morphed expressions, even when they assign them to a
common category. Experiment 4 has taken this point a step further, by showing
not only that people are sensitive to differences between expressions which they
assign to a common overall category, but that they can have some insight into the
nature of these differences.
However, one should not overestimate the extent of this insight, which was
elicited by a forced-choice procedure, where subjects were made to select 3 labels
for each face. Etcoff and Magee (1992) had included a ‘free naming’ task in which
subjects were shown each picture and encouraged to describe the expression using
whatever words or labels they wished",Deep Learning and Machine Learning,"The article discusses four experiments that explore how people perceive facial expressions of emotions.

308,,Enhanced emotion detection and altered neural processing as faces become more iconic,,"Iconic representations are ubiquitous; they fill children’s cartoons, add humor to newspapers, and bring emotional tone to online communication. Yet, the communicative function they serve remains unaddressed by cognitive psychology. Here, we examined the hypothesis that iconic representations communicate emotional information more efficiently than their realistic counterparts. In Experiment 1, we manipulated low-level features of emotional faces to create five sets of stimuli that ranged from photorealistic to fully iconic. Participants identified emotions on briefly presented faces. Results showed that, at short presentation times, accuracy for identifying emotion on more “cartoonized” images was enhanced. In addition, increasing contrast and decreasing featural complexity benefited accuracy. In Experiment 2, we examined an event-related potential component, the P1, which is sensitive to low-level visual stimulus features. Lower levels of contrast and complexity within schematic stimuli were also associated with lower P1 amplitudes. These findings support the hypothesis that iconic representations differ from realistic images in their ability to communicate specific information, including emotion, quickly and efficiently, and that this effect is driven by changes in low-level visual features in the stimuli.","Iconic faces can be viewed either as analogous to realistic images or as a distinct class of stimulus. Our findings support the view that iconic representations serve a distinct role – to impart specific information quickly and efficiently – and highlight the advantages of simplifying image features and increasing contrast to communicate emotion. In addition, our data suggest that the effects of iconization may not be specific to faces, but rather to any stimulus that has these low-level featural changes. It is thus important to consider that such features are not just potential low-level confounds but contribute to specific communicative functions. However, it is unknown if the discrimination of more subtle real-world types of emotional expression would also benefit from iconic representation (e.g., the ‘Duchenne’ smile, where genuine happiness is expressed with the wrinkling of the corners of the eyes) (Ekman, Davidson, & Friesen, 1990). It may be that iconic images have a communicative advantage only for simple visual information, a hypothesis that invites future research.

The effective communicative role of iconic images may underlie the ubiquity and popularity of iconic imagery and cartoons in popular culture. Better understanding of the factors that enhance their communicative role may help improve their use in various real-world applications such as emoticons, signs, and concept cartoons.

It varies over time, since it is a natural instinctive state of mind deriving from one’s circumstances, mood, or relationships with others. Since emotions vary over time, it is important to understand and analyze them appropriately. Existing works have mostly focused well on recognizing basic emotions from human faces. However, the emotion recognition from cartoon images has not been extensively covered. Therefore, in this paper, we present an integrated Deep Neural Network (DNN) approach that deals with recognizing emotions from cartoon images. Since state-of-works do not have large amount of data, we collected a dataset of size 8 K from two cartoon characters: ‘Tom’ & ‘Jerry’ with four different emotions, namely happy, sad, angry, and surprise. The proposed integrated DNN approach, trained on a large dataset consisting of animations for both the characters (Tom and Jerry), correctly identifies the character, segments their face masks, and recognizes the consequent emotions with an accuracy score of 0.96. The approach utilizes Mask R-CNN for character detection and state-of-the-art deep learning models, namely ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, and VGG 16 for emotion classification. In our study, to classify emotions, VGG 16 outperforms others with an accuracy of 96% and F1 score of 0.85. The proposed integrated DNN outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.","Recognizing emotions from facial expressions of faces other than human beings is an interesting and challenging problem.

311,,Exploring Co-Training Strategies for Opinion Detection,,"For the last decade or so, sentiment analysis, which aims to automatically identify opinions, polarities, or emotions from user-generated content (e.g., blogs, tweets), has attracted interest from both academic and industrial communities. Most sentiment analysis strategies fall into 2 categories: lexicon-based and corpusbased approaches. While the latter often requires sentiment-labeled data to build a machine learning model, both approaches need sentiment-labeled data for evaluation. Unfortunately, most data domains lack sufficient quantities of labeled data, especially at the subdocument level. Semisupervised learning (SSL), a machine learning technique that requires only a few labeled examples and can automatically label unlabeled data, is a promising strategy to deal with the issue of insufficient labeled data. Although previous studies have shown promising results of applying various SSL algorithms to solve a sentiment-analysis problem, co-training, an SSL algorithm, has not attracted much attention for sentiment analysis largely due to its restricted assumptions. Therefore, this study focuses on revisiting co-training in depth and discusses several co-training strategies for sentiment analysis following a loose assumption. Results suggest that co-training can be more effective than can other currently adopted SSL methods for sentiment analysis.","Sentiment is an important aspect of many types of information and being able to identify and organize sentiments or opinions is essential for information studies. Prior sentiment analysis studies have suggested that a large number of sentiment-bearing features are necessary for capturing subtle sentiments. However, researchers often face the challenge of limited amounts of sentiment-labeled data from which sentiment-bearing features can be extracted, especially at the sentence level. This shortage of labeled data has become a severe challenge for developing effective sentiment-analysis systems. While opinion labeled data are limited, researchers can easily access plenty of unlabeled opinions on the Web. Therefore, this research investigated several SSL algorithms, which require only a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data, to tackle this challenge. Specifically, this study examined co-training, a simple and effective SSL algorithm which has not received enough attention from sentiment-analysis researchers, mainly due to the restricted assumptions of the original co-training algorithms. Four different co-training strategies were developed under loose co-training assumptions and were tested against three data domains with different characteristics (i.e., movie reviews, news articles, and blog posts). For movie reviews, all co-training strategies attained state-ofthe-art results with a small number of labeled sentences. Due to the nature of the movie-review data, opinion detection in movie reviews is an “easy” problem because it involves genre classification and thus relies, strictly speaking, on distinguishing movie reviews from plot summaries. For other manually created data sets that are expected to reflect real opinion characteristics, the co-training approach was impeded by low baseline precision and demonstrated only limited improvement. For news articles, co-training was able to achieve slight improvement in performance over supervised learning using only labeled data. Blog posts are the most challenging domain, and blog data showed no benefits from implementing any co-training strategies. Nevertheless, strategies developed in this study can be easily adapted to other sentiment-analysis tasks and potentially solve the problem of insufficient quantities of labeled data, given that the initial supervised learning performance is not too low. Future study includes further investigation of co-training strategies that work for data domains where sentiment analysis is particularly difficult. Co-training strategies also will be examined for other sentiment-analysis tasks such as polarity detection and emotion classifications.",sentiment analysis,"The text discusses sentiment analysis, which aims to identify opinions, emotions, and polarities from user-generated content.

Most existing feature extraction methods use only local context information (LCI) in a clause or a sentence (such as co-occurrence or dependency relation) for extraction. But global context information (GCI) is also helpful. In this paper, we propose a combined approach, which integrates LCI and GCI to extract and rank features based on feature score and frequency.

314,,OpinionFlow: Visual Analysis of Opinion Diffusion on Social Media,"Opinion visualization, opinion diffusion, opinion flow, influence estimation, kernel density estimation, level-of-detail","— It is important for many different applications such as government and business intelligence to analyze and explore the diffusion of public opinions on social media. However, the rapid propagation and great diversity of public opinions on social media pose great challenges to effective analysis of opinion diffusion. In this paper, we introduce a visual analysis system called OpinionFlow to empower analysts to detect opinion propagation patterns and glean insights. Inspired by the information diffusion model and the theory of selective exposure, we develop an opinion diffusion model to approximate opinion propagation among Twitter users. Accordingly, we design an opinion flow visualization that combines a Sankey graph with a tailored density map in one view to visually convey diffusion of opinions among many users. A stacked tree is used to allow analysts to select topics of interest at different levels. The stacked tree is synchronized with the opinion flow visualization to help users examine and compare diffusion patterns across topics. Experiments and case studies on Twitter data demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of OpinionFlow.","This paper presents a visual analysis system called OpinionFlow, which enables analysts to visually explore and trace opinion diffusion on Twitter.

By integrating data analysis models and interactive visualizations, the system allows users to unfold discovered patterns, to form various hypotheses regarding opinion diffusion patterns, and to validate hypotheses through interactions with the visualizations. In the future, we plan to improve system performance by implementing parallel algorithms of data analysis such as parallel BRT, so that we can deploy the system on the Web.

Surveys by Pang and Lee (Found Trends Inf Retr 2(1–2):1–135, 2008), Liu and Zhang (A survey of opinion mining and sentiment analysis. In: Aggarwal CC, Zhai C (eds) In: Mining text data. Springer, New York, pp 415–463, 2012), and Mohammad (Mohammad Sentiment analysis: detecting valence, emotions, and other effectual states from text. In: Meiselman H (ed) Emotion measurement. Elsevier, Amsterdam, 2016b) give summaries of the many automatic classifiers, features, and datasets used to detect sentiment. In this chapter, we flesh out some of the challenges that still remain, questions that have not been explored sufficiently, and new issues emerging from taking on new sentiment analysis problems. We also discuss proposals to deal with these challenges. The goal of this chapter is to equip researchers and practitioners with pointers to the latest developments in sentiment analysis and encourage more work in the diverse landscape of problems, especially those areas that are relatively less explored.","Applications of sentiment analysis benefit from the fact that even though systems are not extremely accurate at determining sentiment of individual sentences, they can accurately capture significant changes in the proportion of instances that are positive (or negative). It is also worth noting that such sentiment tracking systems are more effective when incorporating carefully chosen baselines. For example, knowing the percentage of tweets that are negative towards Russian President, Vladimir Putin, is less useful than, for instance, knowing: the percentage of tweets that are negative towards Putin before vs. after the invasion of Crimea; or, the percentage of tweets that are negative towards Putin in Russia vs. the rest of the world; or, the percentage of tweets negative towards Putin vs. Barack Obama (US president). Sentiment analysis is commonly applied in several areas including tracking sentiment towards products, movies, politicians, and companies (O’Connor et al. 2010; Pang and Lee 2008), improving customer relation models (Bougie et al. 2003), detecting happiness and well-being (Schwartz et al. 2013), tracking the stock market (Bollen et al. 2011), and improving automatic dialogue systems (Velásquez 1997; Ravaja et al. 2006). The sheer volume of work in this area precludes detailed summarization here. Nonetheless, it should be noted that often the desired application can help direct certain design choices in the sentiment analysis system. For example, the threshold between neutral and positive sentiment and the threshold between neutral and negative sentiment can be determined empirically by what 4 Challenges in Sentiment Analysis 77 is most suitable for the target application. Similarly, as suggested earlier, some applications may require only the identification of strongly positive and strongly negative instances.",sentiment analysis,"The text discusses the challenges and opportunities in sentiment analysis, which involves developing accurate classifiers to detect sentiment in text.

318,,eSAP: A decision support framework for enhanced sentiment analysis and polarity classification,Sentiment analysis SentiWordNet Movie reviews Text mining Polarity detection Sentiment orientation Social media,"Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is an imperative research area of natural language processing. It is used to determine the writer’s attitude or speaker’s opinion towards a particular person, product or topic. Polarity or subjectivity classification is the process of categorizing a piece of text into positive or negative classes. In recent years, various supervised and unsupervised methods have been presented to accomplish sentiment polarity detection. SentiWordNet (SWN) has been extensively used as a lexical resource for opinion mining. This research incorporates SWN as the labeled training corpus where the sentiment scores are extracted based on the part of speech information. A vocabulary SWNV with revised sentiment scores, generated from SWN, is then used for Support Vector Machines model learning and classification process. Based on this vocabulary, a framework named “Enhanced Sentiment Analysis and Polarity Classification (eSAP)” is proposed. Training, testing and evaluation of the proposed eSAP are conducted on seven benchmark datasets from various domains. 10-fold cross validated accuracy, precision, recall, and fmeasure results averaged over seven datasets for the proposed framework are 80.82%, 80.83%, 80.94% and 80.81% respectively. A notable performance improvement of 13.4% in accuracy, 14.2% in precision, 6.9% in recall and 11.1% in f-measure is observed on average by evaluating the proposed eSAP against the baseline SWN classifier. State of the art performance comparison is conducted which also verifies the superiority of the proposed eSAP framework.","The application of supervised learning has been the prime research focus for text classification. Labeled datasets are required in order to train supervised classifiers.

SentiWordNet and MPQA are the most used lexicons that are usually extended with words that are used in Twitter. This survey presented an overview on the recent updates of TSA. More than 50 articles were categorized and briefly described. After the analysis, it is clear that TSA is still an open field for research. We reviewed the most prominent approaches for TSA and discussed prevalent methods for Twitter-based opinion retrieval, tracking sentiments over time, irony detection, emotion detection, and tweet sentiment quantification. In addition, we presented different resources (datasets and sentiment lexicons) that have been used in TSA. Our survey gave a comprehensive review of the proposed TSA methods, discussed related trends, identified interesting open problems, and indicated promising future research directions.",sentiment analysis,"The text discusses the recent research interest in sentiment analysis on Twitter, which involves analyzing tweets to determine the opinion they express.

322,,Long Short-term Memory Network over Rhetorical Structure Theory for Sentence-level Sentiment Analysis,": LSTM, Rhetorical Structure Theory, sentiment analysis","Using deep learning models to solve sentiment analysis of sentences is still a challenging task. Long short-term memory (LSTM) network solves the gradient disappeared problem existed in recurrent neural network (RNN), but LSTM structure is linear chain-structure that can’t capture text structure information. Afterwards, Tree-LSTM is proposed, which uses LSTM forget gate to skip sub-trees that have little effect on the results to get good performance. It illustrates that the chain-structured LSTM more strongly depends on text structure. However, Tree-LSTM can’t clearly figure out which sub-trees are important and which sub-trees have little effect. We propose a simple model which uses Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) for text parsing. By building LSTM network on RST parse structure, we make full use of LSTM structural characteristics to automatically enhance the nucleus information and filter the satellite information of text. Furthermore, this approach can make the representations concerning the relations between segments of text, which can improve text semantic representations. Experiment results show that this method not only has higher classification accuracy, but also trains quickly.","During learning process of text features, further emphasizing the structure of text helps to improve the feature representation, thereby improving the classification accuracy. We propose RST-LSTM model that build deep learning network on RST parse tree. Each node in RST parse tree represents the nucleus segment or the satellite segment. The model can selectively integrate information of child nodes to update cell state by using their corresponding forget gates and captures long-distance relationship. Introducing RST into the sentence-level sentiment classification task and deeply studying the relations features of text make semantic combination based on text structure more accurate. The model is trained on Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset Socher et al. (2013). Experimental results show that the model not only has higher classification accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods, which improves the accuracy about 2 percent, but also trains quickly.",sentiment analysis,"The text discusses the challenges of using deep learning models for sentiment analysis of sentences.

323,,Combine HowNet lexicon to train phrase recursive autoencoder for sentence-level sentiment analysis,Sentiment analysis Recursive autoencoder HowNet lexicon Phrase structure tree,"Detecting sentiment of sentences in online reviews is still a challenging task. Traditional machine learning methods often use bag-of-words representations which cannot properly capture complex linguistic phenomena in sentiment analysis. Recently, recursive autoencoder (RAE) methods have been proposed for sentence-level sentiment analysis. They use word embedding to represent each word, and learn compositional vector representation of phrases and sentences with recursive autoencoders. Although RAE methods outperform other state-of-the-art sentiment prediction approaches on commonly used datasets, they tend to generate very deep parse trees, and need a large amount of labeled data for each node during the process of learning compositional vector representations. Furthermore, RAE methods mainly combine adjacent words in sequence with a greedy strategy, which make capturing semantic relations between distant words difficult. To solve these issues, we propose a semi-supervised method which combines HowNet lexicon to train phrase recursive autoencoders (we call it CHL-PRAE). CHL-PRAE constructs the phrase recursive autoencoder (PRAE) model at first. Then the model calculates the sentiment orientation of each node with the HowNet lexicon, which acts as sentiment labels, when we train the softmax classifier of PRAE. Furthermore, our CHL-PRAE model conducts bidirectional training to capture global information. Compared with RAE and some supervised methods such as support vector machine (SVM) and naïve Bayesian on English and Chinese datasets, the experiment results show that CHL-PRAE can provide the best performance for sentence-level sentiment analysis.","In this paper, we propose a novel method that combines HowNet lexicon to train bidirectional PRAE model for sentiment analysis on different datasets. Compared with the existing methods, the experimental results show that our model outperforms other approaches in sentiment classification tasks. What is more, the training time and computational complexity are reduced because of the construction of phrase-level binary tree. Despite the success of the proposed method, Bi-CHL-PRAE model still requires further improvement, such as the algorithm of converting phrase dependency tree to phrase-level binary tree. In future works, we will consider some other approaches and validate them through experiments. Besides, the Bi-CHL-PRAE model construct deep learning network based on the parse tree of text and HowNet Lexicon, which lead that good or bad feature representations largely depend on syntax tree structure and the quality of HowNet Lexicon which both have some limits. So the optimization of syntax parse tree and HowNet Lexicon are important exploring directions in the future. In addition, we will study our model on more datasets.",sentiment analysis,"The text discusses the challenges of detecting sentiment in online reviews using traditional machine learning methods and the potential of recursive autoencoder (RAE) methods for sentence-level sentiment analysis.

325,,Recognizing Opinion Sources Based on a New Categorization of Opinion Types,,"Recognizing sources of opinions is an important task in sentiment analysis. Different from previous works which categorize an opinion according to whether the source is the writer or the source is a noun phrase, we propose a new categorization of opinions according to the role that the source plays. The source of a participant opinion is a participant in the event that triggers the opinion. On the contrary, the source of a non-participant opinion is not a participant. Based on this new categorization, we classify an opinion using phrase-level embeddings. A transductive learning method is used for the classifier since there is no existing annotated corpora of this new categorization. A joint prediction model of Probabilistic Soft Logic then recognizes the sources of the two types of opinions in a single model. The experiments have shown that our model improves recognizing sources of opinions over baselines and several state-of-the-art works.",This work improves recognizing sources of opinions based on a new categorization of opinions: non-participant opinion or participant opinion.

Social media contain a large amount of raw data that has been uploaded by users in the form of text, videos, photos 
and audio. The data can be converted into valuable information by using sentiment analysis. A systematic review of studies 
published between 2014 to 2019 was undertaken using the following trusted and credible database including ACM, Emerald 
Insight, IEEE Xplore, Science Direct and Scopus. After the initial and in-depth screening of paper, 24 out of 77 articles have been 
chosen from the review process. The articles have been reviewed based on the aim of the study. The result shows most of the 
articles applied opinion-lexicon method to analyses text sentiment in social media, extracted data on microblogging site mainlyTwitter and sentiment analysis application can be seen in world events, healthcare, politics and business","The conducted systematic literature review provides information on studies on sentiment analysis in social media. 
The paper makes the following three contributions. First, we show what is the method used in analyzing sentiment in 
social media. There is various method introduced by researches, still, the most common method uses in Lexicon based 
method is SentiWordnet and TF-IDF while for machine learning is Naïve Bayes and SVM. Choosing the appropriate 
method of sentiment analysis is depending on the data itself. Both methods demonstrated a similar accuracy. The 
things that need to take into consideration is the structure of the text, time and amount of data. If the data structure is 
messy, a small amount of data and limited time available to analyses, it is recommended to go for lexicon-based 
method. Bigger data is suitable for machine learning based method as it requires more time and data to train. In order 
to improve the quality and accuracy of the result, it is suggested to combine both lexicon and machine learning method. 
 Second, we identify what is the most common type of social media site to extract information for sentiment 
analysis. The most popular social media site to extract information is Twitter. Most of the reviewed paper use twitter 
as their social media context. This is due to the availability, accessibility and richness of Twitter content. There are 
millions of tweets every day on almost any topic. This indicates that social media is becoming a precious source of 
information. However, less attention is given to other social media sources such as blogs, WordPress, YouTube and 
others. The content of each social media might be different, and it is worth exploring other sources might open to new 
knowledge and findings. 
 Third, we demonstrate the application of sentiment analysis in social media. Sentiment analysis has a broad 
application and can be utilized in different areas such as improving quality and strategy in business, political 
forecasting an election result, monitor disease outbreak, create awareness on the importance of data security, 
perception towards a particular sport, and improve locate and response to the disaster. This shows that sentiment 
analysis plays a huge role to understand people perception and helps in decision making. For future recommendation,

Reproducibility studies 
Causal rule prediction","Sentiment analysis has proven to be a valuable tool to gauge public opinion in different disciplines. It has been 
successfully employed in financial market prediction, health issues, customer analytics, commercial valuation 
assessment, brand marketing, politics, crime prediction, and emergency management. Many of the published 
studies have focused on sentiment analysis of Twitter messages, mainly because a large and diverse population 
expresses opinions about almost any topic daily on this platform. This paper proposes a comprehensive review of 
the multifaceted reality of sentiment analysis in social networks. We not only review the existing methods for 
sentiment analysis in social networks from an academic perspective, but also explore new aspects such as 
temporal dynamics, causal relationships, and applications in industry. We also study domains where these 
techniques have been applied, and discuss the practical applicability of emerging Artificial Intelligence methods. 
This paper emphasizes the importance of temporal characterization and causal effects in sentiment analysis in 
social networks, and explores their applications in different contexts such as stock market value, politics, and 
cyberbullying in educational centers. A strong interest from industry in this discipline can be inferred by the 
intense activity we observe in the field of intellectual protection, with more than 8,000 patents issued on the 
topic in only five years. This interest compares positively with the effort from academia, with more than 2,300 
articles published in 15 years. But these papers are unevenly split across domains: there is a strong presence in 
marketing, politics, economics, and health, but less activity in other domains such as emergencies. Regarding the 
techniques employed, traditional techniques such as dictionaries, neural networks, or Support Vector Machines 
are widely represented. In contrast, we could still not find a comparable representation of advanced state-of-theart techniques such as Transformers-based systems like BERT, T5, T0++, or GPT-2/3. This reality is consistent 
with the results found by the authors of this work, where computationally expensive tools such as GPT-3 are 
challenging to apply to achieve competitive results compared to those from simpler, lighter and more conventional techniques. These results, together with the interest shown by industry and academia, suggest that there is 
still ample room for research opportunities on domains, techniques and practical applications, and we expect to 
keep observing a sustained cadence in the number of published papers, patents and commercial tools made 
available.","Regarding technologies, it should be noted that the traditional ones 
(lexicons, tokens, Bayesian methods, bag of words) are still widely used 
whereas the newest methods (auto-regressive and encoder-decoder 
transformers) are not yet in widespread use. This may be due to the 
fact that the classic techniques are well established and are more 
affordable or more approachable for multidisciplinary teams. If we 
compare techniques across domains, we don’t see a significant difference in terms of the mix of techniques applied in each of the domains. 
Regarding the specific techniques applied, the use of lexicons, Word2vec, and n-grams stands out. Transformer-based techniques emerge, but 
to a lesser extent, and newer and more complex models such as T5, 
T0++, GPT-3 or GPT-J are infrequently cited. We believe that the use of 
these large pre-trained models will represent a future paradigm in 
sentiment analysis, as in many other disciplines, especially when zeroshot, one-shot or few-shot learning models are applicable. While this 
appears to be the case, preliminary outcomes of the reproducibility 
analyses performed in this work still yield very limited results. In 
particular, for the simple experiments carried out using GPT-J and GPT3 over the TweetEval dataset, we scored only 57.0 and 58.4 (macroaveraged recall), respectively, which compare poorly with the state of 
the art from traditional methods, and suggest that careful domain 
adaptation is still needed",Deep Learning and Machine Learning,"The article discusses the importance of sentiment analysis in various fields and its application in social networks.

329,,A review on sentiment analysis and emotion detection from text,Afective computing · Natural language processing · Opinion mining · Pre-processing · Word embedding,"Social networking platforms have become an essential means for communicating feelings to the entire world due to rapid 
expansion in the Internet era. Several people use textual content, pictures, audio, and video to express their feelings or 
viewpoints. Text communication via Web-based networking media, on the other hand, is somewhat overwhelming. Every 
second, a massive amount of unstructured data is generated on the Internet due to social media platforms. The data must be 
processed as rapidly as generated to comprehend human psychology, and it can be accomplished using sentiment analysis, 
which recognizes polarity in texts. It assesses whether the author has a negative, positive, or neutral attitude toward an item, 
administration, individual, or location. In some applications, sentiment analysis is insufcient and hence requires emotion 
detection, which determines an individual’s emotional/mental state precisely. This review paper provides understanding into 
levels of sentiment analysis, various emotion models, and the process of sentiment analysis and emotion detection from text. 
Finally, this paper discusses the challenges faced during sentiment and emotion analysis","In this paper, a review of the existing techniques for both 
emotion and sentiment detection is presented. As per the 
paper’s review, it has been analyzed that the lexicon-based

adaptable and straightforward to apply, whereas the corpusbased method is built on rules that function efectively in a 
certain domain. As a result, corpus-based approaches are 
more accurate but lack generalization. The performance of 
machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms
